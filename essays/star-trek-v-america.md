# Star Trek v. America

## Introduction

In MANY, MANY WAYS, the next quote is a roadmap for EXACTLY WHY we will NEVER have anything like the future that is shown and promised in every iteration of Star Trek:

>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. *The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.* From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties... the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operation of government.

\- James Madison, the Father of the American Constitution and future 4th President of the United States
Excerpt From "An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States" by
Charles A. Beard

The reason I use the notion of "Future 4th President" is because this essay, like every essay in this book, attempts to do a few things at the same time:

(1) Take the Originalist viewpoint and position that the Constitution should be interpreted strictly from the Framers' thought models and explicated as to what was written in the text at the time for ALL future controversies
(2) By taking (1) seriously, it presupposes that the the Framers were omniscient at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and could know ALL possible outcomes and CHOSE the current set of outcomes that we experience, right now, at the time of this writing here in 2024. Why? Because that was what was best FOR THEM and who they thought would be their descendents, not just biologically, but also economically and politically.

At this point, you may be thinking? "That's crazy!" Possibly. However, that's the GOVERNINIG presupposition and philosophy that runs the Federalist Society, the conservative, Republican-aligned judicial society that thousands of lawyers and federal, state, and local district judges subscribe to. The current Republican-appointed supermajority on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) are ALL Federalist Society members. Ergo, they are all governed by a theory of implicit Framer omniscience in their decision-making.

The purpose of this essay, and every essay in this book, is to make the implicit explicit. And to explore the omniscience of the Framers by way of another model, ["The Purpose of a System is What It Does" (POSIWID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does)

Also, just to be clear, it could SEEM like the this book of essays is about judging the past from the future. It's actually the exact opposite: it's about thinking about HOW the Framers would have thought about our Present (their Future) and do their level best to try to stop it. One idea that they likely engaged in was [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys). By building in a process of automatic enshittification, whenever systems *changed*, the systemic response was to make the environment worse in order to justify preventing more fixes.

Why? To keep both political and economic power in the hands of white male oligarchs forever, no matter how much the country changes demographically.

I'm going to define a core idea here ("presupposition") and explain why it's so central to this book:

**A presupposition is something that is assumed to be true prior to making a statement. It forms part of the background beliefs or context for the statement to have meaning.**

There's a structural view of human nature that Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison had that was presuppositional to EVERYTHING in the original Constitution. It was the idea that ONLY rich white men were people who deserved agency and freedom. If you weren't a rich white male with property, you WERE NOT A PERSON worthy of agency and freedom.

Let me say that again: If you weren't a rich white male with property, you WERE NOT A PERSON worthy of agency and freedom.

We often think the Framers were a group of brilliant dudes who made this gigantic philosophical jump from being the King's subjects to revolution to individual agency.

Nope. They were iterators not that different from me and you who AT BEST could only see a little bit past the current state of the art (which at the time was some mixture of the Magna Carter and the Protestant Reformation). The core innovation was that UNTITLED land owners (aka NOT barons) could actually have political agency and individual freedom. But even dealing with these free agents required some thought. How do you circumscribe them in such a way that they experience freedom but not so much that the system collapses?

This is where the rivalry between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson comes in.

## Structural View of Human Nature

Hamilton was a big fan of Thomas Hobbes, a (English?) philosopher who believed that the inherent nature of mankind was "nasty, brutish and short". Hobbes grew up in a Christian society and this worldview was constructed likely through some kind of Calvinist doctrine of the "Total Depravity of Man". This presupposed that because of the Fall of Man from Genesis 2 of the Bible has EVERYONE be born in sin and therefore corrupt, mankind was therefore utterly corrupted and needed strong, authoritarian controls in order to not fuck up things too badly. Also, as a bonus, this view of human nature worked REALLY WELL as a governing philosophy for colonialism as well, because white Christian men are going in to foreign lands to bring savages to heel and bring Jesus to them.

Thomas Jefferson had a different point-of-view: he was a subscriber to a philosopher named Jean-Jacques Rousseau ("JJR"). JJR's philosophy was that humanity's starting point was a "state of nature" (feels like a pre-Fall of Man Garden of Eden vibe). JJR however also argued that when humanity invented capitalism, property, and civilization, that's when things started going off the rails and more government was needed.

Jefferson had a pretty strong conflict-of-interest about all this. Because he had inherited ALL of his property, both from his father when TJ was 14 and again and from John Wayles, after his marriage to Martha Wayles and had NEVER worked a day in his life to acquire property of his own, he wanted to be as UNFETTERED as possible (JJR) but he also wanted others who might be tempted to regulate his property to be prevented from taking or regulating his property.

Fortunately for both men, the solution to reconcile these wildly different views was to implicitly re-classify EVERYONE who wasn't in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia in the Summer of 1787 as "pets". Think about it:

- In divorce, parents STILL fight over "who has custody" over the child (implicitly in that is the question of "is the child property?")
- Once a woman marries a man, all of her property and agency are re-assigned to her husband
- This also applied to slaves, laborers, Native American "savages", etc.

So yeah, once Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and others were resolved to classify everyone who WAS NOT in the room as "pets", "We the People" really ONLY meant those oligarchs and their buddies were what the Constitution applied to in terms of enumerating "negative rights" to (meaning the government COULD NOT restrict you from something, but it also could not guarantee anything to be provided for). Which is quite convenient for the oligarch who already has everything he needs. It also conveniently prevents we pets from asking for things because WE DON'T MATTER in the political calculus. AND as a bonus: if we think we matter, when we actually don't, that's OUR delusion and problem, not the oligarchs.

So it's **EASY** to make up that there are TWO AMERICAS: one for the rich white male that should have power forever and one for the rest of us pets. However, that's just not true. It's ONE house, with rules and assumptions for the owners (the oligarchs) and rules for the pets (the non-oligarchs). And just to be clear: an American oligarch is someone who is a white male who has a net worth of $100M or higher.

I have no doubt this division can feel ARBITRARY to the reader, and that's the point. It IS arbitrary, based on the assumptions of 1787 and WHO the Framers said ACTUALLY mattered. Again, read the James Madison quote at the beginning of this essay. There's a LOT MORE to this which will be covered in other essays, but in essence, what the oligarchs were trying to do was create a set of operational and narrative constructs to shut down any challenge to their power then, now, or in the future. They REALLY thought (and James Madison basically said so) that they should have power and property FOREVER and the government's first job is to guarantee the stability of that economic and political power, no matter how much the country changes.

This founding presupposition creates the legal, social, structural and narrative frameworks for [Caste](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230272), racism, misogyny, gender inequities (economic, social, and political), able-ism, neurodivergent and mental health stigmas, and other kinds of socioeconomic forms of discrimination that stitch our society together with some very ugly seams.

## Star Trek, from the Future of 1787

To the oligarchs, the ideas that are expressed and encapsulated in the Star Trek multiverse would be crazy-making and anathema because it would FORCE THEM to have to compete for political and sexual power, as well as be challenged by the idea that economic power games like capitalism were more ethereal. Let's go through the list of ideas expressed in Star Trek that would make a dude like James Madison crazy:

### Presuppositional commitment to pure empiricism

The idea that you'd have to actually measure and collect the data from a  phenomena, and THEN have a commitment to that data taking the scientist where it goes, rather than something that is automatically predisposed to supporting rich white dudes acquiring even more money would be clinically insane to the dudes of 1787.

### The JJR view of Human Nature being basically good

Humans would be operating as adults and practicing decent emotional self-regulation. They wouldn't play the victim and they'd also take responsibility when things weren't working. They'd also actively resist allowing their system of governance (the Federation, Starfleet, and various member planets) to enshittify themselves.

What's the fun in that for the rich white dudes? I mean, if they can't exploit prey on someone else's psychological or systemic weaknesses, what is the actual point of its existence?

### Adult men and women are automatically given equality, both narratively and societally

Setting aside all the controversy around gender roles and their pronouns, the typical man and woman in the Federation starts off automatically equal independent of their "status", because status (beyond Starfleet ranks) doesn't really exist. Men and women and non-binaries are basically equal, and can initiate and engage in mating rituals with reputational, familial, or economic consequences beyond whether or not they break their specific relationship contracts with their partners. Also, women get to keep their property before and after a relationship as opposed to having it automatically assigned to their spouse and losing it in the wake of a breakup or a divorce.

The Framers would be HORRIFIED at this idea. After all, if they couldn't force sex on anyone they wanted to have sex with, how would they EVER get laid? Also, being the beneficiaries of "marital property rights" is probably the fastest way for them to actually succeed: just marry a rich widow and watch all of her inheritance transfer to you (this is something that happened to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson).

Never mind the fact that if women could actually challenge men politically and economically, than a lot of the economically soft rich white dudes (Madison, Jefferson, and Washington) might never have ascended at all. That thought HORRIFIED our blessed Framers: the idea that women MIGHT actually have good ideas worthy of being listened to? That's insane. That's like saying my Golden Retriever should be listened to for governance of the household, as opposed to only producing puppies and being available for Jefferson and Madison to fuck and breed whenever they wanted to.

SPECIAL NOTE: At this point, you should be thinking something like "wow, that implication of bestiality is gross man" and you'd be spot-on. But since non-rich white dudes were considered pets, whenever a rich white dude has sex with a pet, that's BESTIALITY. A weird form, to be sure, but stil a form.

SECOND SPECIAL NOTE: Unless you're a rich white dude, the government still classifies you as a pet. And again, just to be clear, $100M is the buy-in. This is WHEN the government will respond to you easily. Likely because (1) the Senate in any given Congress is roughly 70% white men (that percentage is painfully slowly going down) and (2) you've got enough money to either (a) create a super PAC or (b) have enough oligarch friends that are listened to such that you're taken care of.

### Positive human rights are (automatically) granted, not subverted

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a good starting point. There's a number of positive rights in there. One of them, Article 6, is a doozy: *Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.*

Currently, here in America, both legislatures and the courts have the power to declare who is a person and who isn't. That power was first exercised in the Constitution, in the form of the 3/5th clause for slaves being counted as part of the decennial census.

For universal recognition of an individual human being to be granted personhood (which is a positive right), this capacity for our legislatures and courts to determine who's a person would have to be nullified in law and in fact.

The oligarchs have ALWAYS had the right to unfettered personhood since the Constitution was drafted in 1787. They took it for themselves and then implicitly defined it away for everyone who was NOT in the room, or wasn't politically connected to those in the room.

In the Star Trek multiverse, if you're organic AND sentient, you automatically qualify for personhood. I write this not having watched every single last episode from every season of every show. I'm aware that the Next Generation Season 2 episode 9 titled "Measure of a Man" dealt with a version of this issue with Data's personhood even though he was an inorganic being. Also, the ongoing Star Trek: Discovery plotline with the sentient ship computer named Zora deals with a variation of this issue as well.

We pets think that Data's moment in the dock couldn't happen to us. But then you probably should wonder why everyone THINKS the Declaration of Independence (written by our anti-hero, Thomas Jefferson) guarantees things like "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness", which have no legal force in the Constitution, which is the ACTUAL sovereign document over America's legal framework.

(More like "sovereign-ish" but that's the whole point of this book of essays.)

Riiiiiiiiight... the Constitution DOES NOT GUARANTEE a positive right to "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness". In fact, those rights are subverted on the regular. Think I'm kidding? By the time you're reading this, a mass shooting has happened somewhere within the 50 states. Today.

No "right to life" for you!

### War and violence are NOT the first go-to response when encountering difficulties

I can't tell you how many times as a teenager watching "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and being utterly BORED with why Picard showed such ridiculous levels of restraint in following this thing I'd never heard about called "The Prime Directive". Often it had to do with an unwillingness to start a conflict just because he wasn't going to get his way automatically.

It sometimes made for TERRIBLE television in terms of dramatic beats (this was the late 1980s after all) BUT it planted seeds about how to think about conflict for me.

I can almost hear some random Republican politician or Ronald Reagan himself calling Star Trek "Communist" in my head. Even though there's a picture of Reagan visiting the Next Generation set in the early 90s after he left the Presidency.

I mention all this because different Star Trek shows explore different sides of the Prime Directive (both before and after Starfleet committed to its operational use).

So what is the fictional "Prime Directive"? It's the shorthand name for Starfleet Command's General Order 1, which reads as follows: "No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society." It's conceptual roots are based in an anti-colonialist attitude towards colonialism, which has formed and still governs quite a bit of Western Civilization.

Just to explicate something that's implied from the previous section:

According to OUR Constitution, Gene Roddenberry, in case it's not clear, was a favored Pet (being a White Male). Because he wasn't oligarch rich, he couldn't influence the American government directly. So he came up with Star Trek. And Lucille Ball, another, richer Pet, greenlit him.

## Other attributes of the Star Trek multiverse

### Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations

While "credited" to the Vulcan culture (think Mr. Spock), it's the core philosophy of Star Trek and its creator, Gene Roddenberry. Paraphrasing Kagi's AI, [IDIC] reflects the Vulcan belief that truth, beauty and logic (the Vulcan form for "goodness") emerge from the infinite diversity across the universe and how those differences combine.

SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT HATERS: There's a right-wing fallacy that shows up from time to time in Star Trek-based arguments about how right-wing hate (casteism, racism, misogyny, etc) should be accepted with every other viewpoint in an IDIC-driven universe. Nope That's not how it works. To briefly invoke Karl Popper, a tolerant society (a la IDIC) must be intolerant of intolerance otherwise intolerance will spread and destroy the open and tolerant society. This is known as "the paradox of tolerance".

### Post-capitalism economy

Sometimes the Star Trek multiverse has money. Sometimes it doesn't. What you don't hear about is complaints about worker exploitation, cheap labor, gender-fueled pay gaps or other late-stage capitalism-fueled social crises, at least on the member worlds.

Maybe an economics episode would be *boring* for Trekkers, but by measuring the absence of something, the problems caused by late-stage capitalism appear to be at least missing.

### Compassion

Compassion seems to be the opposite of a 4-letter word in Star Trek. A number of episodes revolve around humanitarian initiatives conflicting with the Prime Directive. Also, it's not unusual to see crew members argue FOR doing something those less in need, whether they are fellow Starfleet personnel, Federation member states, or not. Quite the opposite of our so-called "United" States of America.

While a number of actors complained about how Gene Roddenberry banned intracrew conflict on Next Generation, the whole idea of having a different starting point in relating to other crew members and other species other than being shitty or being defensive in the face of said shittiness is still something of a revolutionary idea in contemporary culture.

### Curiosity

The whole "explore strange new worlds" vibe is built into the title opening monologue, recited by William Shatner (Original Series), Patrick Stewart (Next Generation), and Anson Mount (Strange New Worlds). A science officer usually plays a prominent role in the crew or in an episodic plot. Science is revered both in the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 32nd centuries.

Wild, huh? Star Trek posits a vision of what humanity and its sister sentient species can accomplish when exploratory science is practiced by everyone, not just oligarch-approved white dudes.

### Camaraderie

Usually, a number of major plots and arcs reject the "rugged individualism" and "pull oneself up by his bootstraps" plot tropes. THe crew has to be a CREW in order to get through the challenge of the week or the season. They may not always like each other, but they figure out a way to work together.

Unlike some people.

### Private property is basically missing from the plot

As Americans, we typically spend about a third-to-half of our adulthood hours working in a job to acquire resources to acquire some kind of property or other kinds of economic status. That's just not a thing in Trek. Sure, Captains Picard and Pike both owned some sweet pieces of land (Picard a vineyard and Pike a remote snow cabin), BUT because their lives weren't spent working towards those goals or maintaining those goals, they were free to do other things like explore outer space.

Because so many of basic food/clothing/shelter things are handled, the lives of Starfleet personnel can be about something else. I **GET** that it would be easy to think that there's a version of that going on in the contemporary American military, but for many soldiers, the military often occurs as the only option to get to a better life. Picard and Pike (who were both senior officers and also white dudes) didn't have to worry about that. And a lot of their crew likely didn't either.

# The American Legacy

## White Male Supremacy At All Costs

From the perspective of the Framers and the Founders, what was baked in to the Constitution was the implicit goal of keeping the oligarchs in power forever or destroy the country in the process. It was **UNIMAGINABLE** to them to entertain the idea of women or African-Americans or other ethnic minorities achieving real representation and power without widespread (read: practically unanimous) support from the oligarchs.

Given the power dynamics that were baked in from the beginning, it was imperative and encouraged to enlist gender-traitors (we call them Karens) and race-traitors (we call them Uncle Toms) to help provide some kind of political air cover for what the oligarchs had baked in. After all, if Katie Britt could tell us with a straight face in her "fundamentalist baby voice" that America needed more oligarchy (and let's be clear: that's what she was saying) then it's a signal that women don't have to think too deeply and can get behind the status quo, even at their own general expense. And if Clarence Thomas could keep voting to strike down affirmative action programs in various institutions in order to keep oligarchs as close to having nearly universal unchallengeable power in the classrooms that matter and in boardrooms, then that's a signal that what the oligarchs actually do is approved up by an *unqualified* black man who has benefitted from affirmative action. (He placed a 15-cent price tag on his Yale law school degree).

As a result, we live in a society that from a policy perspective, embraces white patriarchy everywhere, especially in leadership bodies. The starting point for policy-makers is to ignore or actively disregard what would be beneficial to women, especially women of color. In the New York Times, there was an article dated on Sept. 9, 2020 titled "Faces of Power". It was an infographic showing how 80% of the most powerful people in America are White. In the 10 Southern state legislatures, there is a an extreme poverty of female legislators (less than 25%) and even LESS than that percentage are Democratic women. And what's the cost of that?

In 2020, probably the ***WORST*** year for a lot of quality-of-life statistics in America, here's how this idea played out as a proxy for patriarchy. Think of Democratic-run states as "anti-patriarchy" and Republican-run states as "pro-patriarchy".

### Crime

- Household Food Insecurity - Democrats do Vastly Better
- STDs: Chlamydia (Gonorrhea) - Democrats do Clearly (Vastly) Better

[You can read the original article showing these statistics here.](https://appliedsentience.com/2020/08/02/summary-of-23-quality-of-life-indicators-are-red-or-blue-states-better/)

But *still*, the narrative warfare played out in the media is that Republicans have a better handle on EVERYTHING in their states, and Democratic-run states are sinking hellholes full of aborted fetuses created by drug-fueled rapists.

Which, to be honest, sounds a lot like Colonizer Projection.

## Colonizer Roots and Colonizer Future

One of the prime ways that colonizers conquered a land region is by overthrowing the indigenous language and culture. Also, any good (meaning usable) ideas were promptly assimilated and exported back to the Mother Country (usually the United Kingdom but Spain was not far behind).

Raping women and creating shadow families was also a part of the deal. If you could "breed out" the native population, then you can sow division more easily by creating a form of "bloodline mistrust". These shadow families are unrecognized in the official histories of either the Imperial records or the indigenous records.

Practicing environmental genocide (what we euphemistically call "terraforming") is another way to literally "conquer the land". Clear-cutting forests for imperial wood (which is something we are STILL doing in the Amazon rainforest) is a thing, and that thing causes mass extinctions of species of animals, flora and fauna, and along with it potential carbon sinks that could have mitigated our CO2-emitting culture.

Lastly, the land itself is just straight-up seized and because of fungible personhood, colonizers basically act like the land just pre-existed and was there for the taking because NO HUMAN was already there. Just a bunch of savages. Whose females were raped and breeded in order to erase said-savages. A version of this story is in any honest history of the Native American genocide during the 17th-19th centuries.

Basically, the colonizer playbook comes down to "erasing the conquered's past to guarantee the conqueror's future". And there's a variation of this that plays out today. Let's get into it.

## Lying about History

There's A LOT of different "birth dates" for America. Here's some of the more famous ones (which may or may not be rigorously "accurate"):

- 1492: Columbus discovers the Americas
- 1619: The first slave ship lands in Jamestown
- 1776: The Declaration of Independence was written and proclaimed
- 1777: The Articles of Confederation were drawn up
- 1781: The Articles of Confederation were unanimously ratified
- 1787: The current United States Constitution was written
- 1789: The Constitution was ratified

A date that's missing from this list is 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was formally signed *recognizing* the United States between representatives of Great Britain and the newly liberated United States. There were also separate peace treaties signed between Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic concluding a long World War, of which the American Colonies were perhaps the largest battlefield.

### The Great Myth at the Heart of the American Revolution

The great myth at the epicenter of the American Revolution is that the Americans, by way of a massively underfunded and under-armored Continental Army, somehow got lucky over and over and over again and defeated the world's preeminent military, the British Imperial Army and Navy, by itself with a very late and very light assist from the French Imperial military.

That idea COULD NOT BE ANY LESS TRUE. The Continental Army could barely afford its supplies since the Continental Congress could not tax its citizens and had to issue payments in the form of bonds, or debtor notes. The whole fight about the national debt that happened much later in George Washington's first term was about this very debt.

In the mean time, the Continental Army's soldiers barely got paid once a year and were massively under-armored in its supplies. And somehow they were destined to defeat the British, the world's greatest military?

Nope.

[The efforts of Silas Deane and then Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War#French_involvement) to convince the Kingdom of France to commit to supporting and then allying with the American war effort was the decisive political, economic and political factor that enabled the eventual military defeat of the British Army.

Once the French Army showed up militarily and not just logistically, George Washington was functionally sidelined from the war effort. He even complained how little command action he was getting because the French had so thoroughly taken up the war effort to defeat the British. At some point the Spanish and the Dutch empires got involved as well, which is what enabled the liberation of the colonies from the British and the eventual Treaty of Paris and its various side treaties.

And yet NO ONE asks WHY, if the Americans **militarily won** the American Revolution, why was the victory treaty negotiated in Paris instead of New York?

Maybe because France's actual role was minimized and erased in the narrative warfare of the American Revolution?

### History rhyming again and again

A version of the same "erasure of the record" happened after the Civil War. Even if the South was militarily and economically defeated at the end of the Civil War, a continuing rear-guard action happens to this very day.

By exploiting a loophole in the 13th Amendment, both public and private prisons can exploit prisoners to engage in uncompensated or incredibly cheap labor for American corporations.

Also, when Reconstruction formally in 1877 as part of the settlement of the Presidential election of 1876, the South began an open and public campaign of terrorism against the formerly enslaved populations. While it is true that there has been *some* progress in the South since the Civil Rights Movement's heyday in the 1960s, the right to vote still does not exist as a positive right and many Southern states employ legislatively sanctioned voter suppression tactics to disenfranchise as many people as possible, especially in the ethnic minorities as well as women.

Given that the Sons and Daughters of the Rebellion completely took over the Republican Party, the party that originally defeated the Confederate government in the War of the Rebellion, I'd venture to say that the South "won" the narrative version of the Civil War through some mixture of physical, narrative, and legislative warfare. Especially AFTER it lost the first round militarily.
