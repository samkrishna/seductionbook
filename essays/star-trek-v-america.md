# Star Trek v. America

## Introduction

In MANY, MANY WAYS, the next quote is a roadmap for EXACTLY WHY we will NEVER have anything like the future that is shown and promised in every iteration of Star Trek:

>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. *The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.* From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties... the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operation of government.

\- James Madison, the Father of the American Constitution and future 4th President of the United States
Excerpt From "An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States" by
Charles A. Beard

The reason I use the notion of "Future 4th President" is because this essay, like every essay in this book, attempts to do a few things at the same time:

(1) Take the Originalist viewpoint and position that the Constitution should be interpreted strictly from the Framers' thought models and explicated as to what was written in the text at the time for ALL future controversies
(2) By taking (1) seriously, it presupposes that the the Framers were omniscient at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and could know ALL possible outcomes and CHOSE the current set of outcomes that we experience, right now, at the time of this writing here in 2024. Why? Because that was what was best FOR THEM and who they thought would be their descendents, not just biologically, but also economically and politically.

At this point, you may be thinking? "That's crazy!" Possibly. However, that's the GOVERNINIG presupposition and philosophy that runs the Federalist Society, the conservative, Republican-aligned judicial society that thousands of lawyers and federal, state, and local district judges subscribe to. The current Republican-appointed supermajority on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) are ALL Federalist Society members. Ergo, they are all governed by a theory of implicit Framer omniscience in their decision-making.

The purpose of this essay, and every essay in this book, is to make the implicit explicit. And to explore the omniscience of the Framers by way of another model, ["The Purpose of a System is What It Does" (POSIWID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does)

Also, just to be clear, it could SEEM like the this book of essays is about judging the past from the future. It's actually the exact opposite: it's about thinking about HOW the Framers would have thought about our Present (their Future) and do their level best to try to stop it. One idea that they likely engaged in was [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys). By building in a process of automatic enshittification, whenever systems *changed*, the systemic response was to make the environment worse in order to justify preventing more fixes.

Why? To keep both political and economic power in the hands of white male oligarchs forever, no matter how much the country changes demographically.

I'm going to define a core idea here ("presupposition") and explain why it's so central to this book:

**A presupposition is something that is assumed to be true prior to making a statement. It forms part of the background beliefs or context for the statement to have meaning.**

There's a structural view of human nature that Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison had that was presuppositional to EVERYTHING in the original Constitution. It was the idea that ONLY rich white men were people who deserved agency and freedom. If you weren't a rich white male with property, you WERE NOT A PERSON worthy of agency and freedom.

Let me say that again: If you weren't a rich white male with property, you WERE NOT A PERSON worthy of agency and freedom.

We often think the Framers were a group of brilliant dudes who made this gigantic philosophical jump from being the King's subjects to revolution to individual agency.

Nope. They were iterators not that different from me and you who AT BEST could only see a little bit past the current state of the art (which at the time was some mixture of the Magna Carter and the Protestant Reformation). The core innovation was that UNTITLED land owners (aka NOT barons) could actually have political agency and individual freedom. But even dealing with these free agents required some thought. How do you circumscribe them in such a way that they experience freedom but not so much that the system collapses?

This is where the rivalry between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson comes in.

## Structural View of Human Nature

Hamilton was a big fan of Thomas Hobbes, a (English?) philosopher who believed that the inherent nature of mankind was "nasty, brutish and short". Hobbes grew up in a Christian society and this worldview was constructed likely through some kind of Calvinist doctrine of the "Total Depravity of Man". This presupposed that because of the Fall of Man from Genesis 2 of the Bible has EVERYONE be born in sin and therefore corrupt, mankind was therefore utterly corrupted and needed strong, authoritarian controls in order to not fuck up things too badly. Also, as a bonus, this view of human nature worked REALLY WELL as a governing philosophy for colonialism as well, because white Christian men are going in to foreign lands to bring savages to heel and bring Jesus to them.

Thomas Jefferson had a different point-of-view: he was a subscriber to a philosopher named Jean-Jacques Rousseau ("JJR"). JJR's philosophy was that humanity's starting point was a "state of nature" (feels like a pre-Fall of Man Garden of Eden vibe). JJR however also argued that when humanity invented capitalism, property, and civilization, that's when things started going off the rails and more government was needed.

Jefferson had a pretty strong conflict-of-interest about all this. Because he had inherited ALL of his property, both from his father when TJ was 14 and again and from John Wayles, after his marriage to Martha Wayles and had NEVER worked a day in his life to acquire property of his own, he wanted to be as UNFETTERED as possible (JJR) but he also wanted others who might be tempted to regulate his property to be prevented from taking or regulating his property.

Fortunately for both men, the solution to reconcile these wildly different views was to implicitly re-classify EVERYONE who wasn't in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia in the Summer of 1787 as "pets". Think about it:

- In divorce, parents STILL fight over "who has custody" over the child (implicitly in that is the question of "is the child property?")
- Once a woman marries a man, all of her property and agency are re-assigned to her husband
- This also applied to slaves, laborers, Native American "savages", etc.

So yeah, once Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and others were resolved to classify everyone who WAS NOT in the room as "pets", "We the People" really ONLY meant those oligarchs and their buddies were what the Constitution applied to in terms of enumerating "negative rights" to (meaning the government COULD NOT restrict you from something, but it also could not guarantee anything to be provided for). Which is quite convenient for the oligarch who already has everything he needs. It also conveniently prevents we pets from asking for things because WE DON'T MATTER in the political calculus. AND as a bonus: if we think we matter, when we actually don't, that's OUR delusion and problem, not the oligarchs.

So it's **EASY** to make up that there are TWO AMERICAS: one for the rich white male that should have power forever and one for the rest of us pets. However, that's just not true. It's ONE house, with rules and assumptions for the owners (the oligarchs) and rules for the pets (the non-oligarchs). And just to be clear: an American oligarch is someone who is a white male who has a net worth of $100M or higher.

I have no doubt this division can feel ARBITRARY to the reader, and that's the point. It IS arbitrary, based on the assumptions of 1787 and WHO the Framers said ACTUALLY mattered. Again, read the James Madison quote at the beginning of this essay. There's a LOT MORE to this which will be covered in other essays, but in essence, what the oligarchs were trying to do was create a set of operational and narrative constructs to shut down any challenge to their power then, now, or in the future. They REALLY thought (and James Madison basically said so) that they should have power and property FOREVER and the government's first job is to guarantee the stability of that economic and political power, no matter how much the country changes.

This founding presupposition creates the legal, social, structural and narrative frameworks for [Caste](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230272), racism, misogyny, gender inequities (economic, social, and political), able-ism, neurodivergent and mental health stigmas, and other kinds of socioeconomic forms of discrimination that stitch our society together with some very ugly seams.

## Star Trek, from the Future of 1787

To the oligarchs, the ideas that are expressed and encapsulated in the Star Trek multiverse would be crazy-making and anathema because it would FORCE THEM to have to compete for political and sexual power, as well as be challenged by the idea that economic power games like capitalism were more ethereal. Let's go through the list of ideas expressed in Star Trek that would make a dude like James Madison crazy:

### Presuppositional commitment to pure empiricism

The idea that you'd have to actually measure and collect the data from a  phenomena, and THEN have a commitment to that data taking the scientist where it goes, rather than something that is automatically predisposed to supporting rich white dudes acquiring even more money would be clinically insane to the dudes of 1787.

### The JJR view of Human Nature being basically good

Humans would be operating as adults and practicing decent emotional self-regulation. They wouldn't play the victim and they'd also take responsibility when things weren't working. They'd also actively resist allowing their system of governance (the Federation, Starfleet, and various member planets) to enshittify themselves.

What's the fun in that for the rich white dudes? I mean, if they can't exploit prey on someone else's psychological or systemic weaknesses, what is the actual point of its existence?

### Adult men and women are automatically given equality, both narratively and societally

Setting aside all the controversy around gender roles and their pronouns, the typical man and woman in the Federation starts off automatically equal independent of their "status", because status (beyond Starfleet ranks) doesn't really exist. Men and women and non-binaries are basically equal, and can initiate and engage in mating rituals with reputational, familial, or economic consequences beyond whether or not they break their specific relationship contracts with their partners. Also, women get to keep their property before and after a relationship as opposed to having it automatically assigned to their spouse and losing it in the wake of a breakup or a divorce.

The Framers would be HORRIFIED at this idea. After all, if they couldn't force sex on anyone they wanted to have sex with, how would they EVER get laid? Also, being the beneficiaries of "marital property rights" is probably the fastest way for them to actually succeed: just marry a rich widow and watch all of her inheritance transfer to you (this is something that happened to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson).

Never mind the fact that if women could actually challenge men politically and economically, than a lot of the economically soft rich white dudes (Madison, Jefferson, and Washington) might never have ascended at all. That thought HORRIFIED our blessed Framers: the idea that women MIGHT actually have good ideas worthy of being listened to? That's insane. That's like saying my Golden Retriever should be listened to for governance of the household, as opposed to only producing puppies and being available for Jefferson and Madison to fuck and breed whenever they wanted to.

SPECIAL NOTE: At this point, you should be thinking something like "wow, that implication of bestiality is gross man" and you'd be spot-on. But since non-rich white dudes were considered pets, whenever a rich white dude has sex with a pet, that's BESTIALITY. A weird form, to be sure, but stil a form.

SECOND SPECIAL NOTE: Unless you're a rich white dude, the government still classifies you as a pet. And again, just to be clear, $100M is the buy-in. This is WHEN the government will respond to you easily. Likely because (1) the Senate in any given Congress is roughly 70% white men (that percentage is painfully slowly going down) and (2) you've got enough money to either (a) create a super PAC or (b) have enough oligarch friends that are listened to such that you're taken care of.

### Positive human rights are (automatically) granted, not subverted

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a good starting point. There's a number of positive rights in there. One of them, Article 6, is a doozy: *Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.*

Currently, here in America, both legislatures and the courts have the power to declare who is a person and who isn't. That power was first exercised in the Constitution, in the form of the 3/5th clause for slaves being counted as part of the decennial census.

For universal recognition of an individual human being to be granted personhood (which is a positive right), this capacity for our legislatures and courts to determine who's a person would have to be nullified in law and in fact.

The oligarchs have ALWAYS had the right to unfettered personhood since the Constitution was drafted in 1787. They took it for themselves and then implicitly defined it away for everyone who was NOT in the room, or wasn't politically connected to those in the room.

In the Star Trek multiverse, if you're organic AND sentient, you automatically qualify for personhood. I write this not having watched every single last episode from every season of every show. I'm aware that the Next Generation Season 2 episode 9 titled "Measure of a Man" dealt with a version of this issue with Data's personhood even though he was an inorganic being. Also, the ongoing Star Trek: Discovery plotline with the sentient ship computer named Zora deals with a variation of this issue as well.

We pets think that Data's moment in the dock couldn't happen to us. But then you probably should wonder why everyone THINKS the Declaration of Independence (written by our anti-hero, Thomas Jefferson) guarantees things like "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness", which have no legal force in the Constitution, which is the ACTUAL sovereign document over America's legal framework.

(More like "sovereign-ish" but that's the whole point of this book of essays.)

Riiiiiiiiight... the Constitution DOES NOT GUARANTEE a positive right to "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness". In fact, those rights are subverted on the regular. Think I'm kidding? By the time you're reading this, a mass shooting has happened somewhere within the 50 states. Today.

No "right to life" for you!

### War and violence are NOT the first go-to response when encountering difficulties

I can't tell you how many times as a teenager watching "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and being utterly BORED with why Picard showed such ridiculous levels of restraint in following this thing I'd never heard about called "The Prime Directive". Often it had to do with an unwillingness to start a conflict just because he wasn't going to get his way automatically.

It sometimes made for TERRIBLE television in terms of dramatic beats (this was the late 1980s after all) BUT it planted seeds about how to think about conflict for me.

I can almost hear some random Republican politician or Ronald Reagan himself calling Star Trek "Communist" in my head. Even though there's a picture of Reagan visiting the Next Generation set in the early 90s after he left the Presidency.

I mention all this because different Star Trek shows explore different sides of the Prime Directive (both before and after Starfleet committed to its operational use).

So what is the fictional "Prime Directive"? It's the shorthand name for Starfleet Command's General Order 1, which reads as follows: "No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society." It's conceptual roots are based in an anti-colonialist attitude towards colonialism, which has formed and still governs quite a bit of Western Civilization.

Just to explicate something that's implied from the previous section:

According to OUR Constitution, Gene Roddenberry, in case it's not clear, was a favored Pet (being a White Male). Because he wasn't oligarch rich, he couldn't influence the American government directly. So he came up with Star Trek. And Lucille Ball, another, richer Pet, greenlit him.

## Other attributes of the Star Trek multiverse

### Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations

While "credited" to the Vulcan culture (think Mr. Spock), it's the core philosophy of Star Trek and its creator, Gene Roddenberry. Paraphrasing Kagi's AI, [IDIC] reflects the Vulcan belief that truth, beauty and logic (the Vulcan form for "goodness") emerge from the infinite diversity across the universe and how those differences combine.

SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT HATERS: There's a right-wing fallacy that shows up from time to time in Star Trek-based arguments about how right-wing hate (casteism, racism, misogyny, etc) should be accepted with every other viewpoint in an IDIC-driven universe. Nope That's not how it works. To briefly invoke Karl Popper, a tolerant society (a la IDIC) must be intolerant of intolerance otherwise intolerance will spread and destroy the open and tolerant society. This is known as "the paradox of tolerance".

### Post-capitalism economy

Sometimes the Star Trek multiverse has money. Sometimes it doesn't. What you don't hear about is complaints about worker exploitation, cheap labor, gender-fueled pay gaps or other late-stage capitalism-fueled social crises, at least on the member worlds.

Maybe an economics episode would be *boring* for Trekkers, but by measuring the absence of something, the problems caused by late-stage capitalism appear to be at least missing.

### Compassion

Compassion seems to be the opposite of a 4-letter word in Star Trek. A number of episodes revolve around humanitarian initiatives conflicting with the Prime Directive. Also, it's not unusual to see crew members argue FOR doing something those less in need, whether they are fellow Starfleet personnel, Federation member states, or not. Quite the opposite of our so-called "United" States of America.

While a number of actors complained about how Gene Roddenberry banned intracrew conflict on Next Generation, the whole idea of having a different starting point in relating to other crew members and other species other than being shitty or being defensive in the face of said shittiness is still something of a revolutionary idea in contemporary culture.

### Curiosity

The whole "explore strange new worlds" vibe is built into the title opening monologue, recited by William Shatner (Original Series), Patrick Stewart (Next Generation), and Anson Mount (Strange New Worlds). A science officer usually plays a prominent role in the crew or in an episodic plot. Science is revered both in the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 32nd centuries.

Wild, huh? Star Trek posits a vision of what humanity and its sister sentient species can accomplish when exploratory science is practiced by everyone, not just oligarch-approved white dudes.

### Camaraderie

Usually, a number of major plots and arcs reject the "rugged individualism" and "pull oneself up by his bootstraps" plot tropes. THe crew has to be a CREW in order to get through the challenge of the week or the season. They may not always like each other, but they figure out a way to work together.

Unlike some people.

### Private property is basically missing from the plot

As Americans, we typically spend about a third-to-half of our adulthood hours working in a job to acquire resources to acquire some kind of property or other kinds of economic status. That's just not a thing in Trek. Sure, Captains Picard and Pike both owned some sweet pieces of land (Picard a vineyard and Pike a remote snow cabin), BUT because their lives weren't spent working towards those goals or maintaining those goals, they were free to do other things like explore outer space.

Because so many of basic food/clothing/shelter things are handled, the lives of Starfleet personnel can be about something else. I **GET** that it would be easy to think that there's a version of that going on in the contemporary American military, but for many soldiers, the military often occurs as the only option to get to a better life. Picard and Pike (who were both senior officers and also white dudes) didn't have to worry about that. And a lot of their crew likely didn't either.

# The American Legacy

## White Male Supremacy At All Costs

From the perspective of the Framers and the Founders, what was baked in to the Constitution was the implicit goal of keeping the oligarchs in power forever or destroy the country in the process. It was **UNIMAGINABLE** to them to entertain the idea of women or African-Americans or other ethnic minorities achieving real representation and power without widespread (read: practically unanimous) support from the oligarchs.

Given the power dynamics that were baked in from the beginning, it was imperative and encouraged to enlist gender-traitors (we call them Karens) and race-traitors (we call them Uncle Toms) to help provide some kind of political air cover for what the oligarchs had baked in. After all, if Katie Britt could tell us with a straight face in her "fundamentalist baby voice" that America needed more oligarchy (and let's be clear: that's what she was saying) then it's a signal that women don't have to think too deeply and can get behind the status quo, even at their own general expense. And if Clarence Thomas could keep voting to strike down affirmative action programs in various institutions in order to keep oligarchs as close to having nearly universal unchallengeable power in the classrooms that matter and in boardrooms, then that's a signal that what the oligarchs actually do is approved up by an *unqualified* black man who has benefitted from affirmative action. (He placed a 15-cent price tag on his Yale law school degree).

As a result, we live in a society that from a policy perspective, embraces white patriarchy everywhere, especially in leadership bodies. The starting point for policy-makers is to ignore or actively disregard what would be beneficial to women, especially women of color. In the New York Times, there was an article dated on Sept. 9, 2020 titled "Faces of Power". It was an infographic showing how 80% of the most powerful people in America are White. In the 10 Southern state legislatures, there is a an extreme poverty of female legislators (less than 25%) and even LESS than that percentage are Democratic women. And what's the cost of that?

In 2020, probably the ***WORST*** year for a lot of quality-of-life statistics in America, here's how this idea played out as a proxy for patriarchy. Think of Democratic-run states as "anti-patriarchy" and Republican-run states as "pro-patriarchy".

### Crime

- Rape - Democrats do Slightly Better
- Robbery - Republicans do Clearly Better
- Car Theft - Democrats do Clearly Better

### Health

- Life Expectancy - Democrats do Vastly Better
- People without Health Insurance - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Infant Mortality - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Household Food Insecurity - Democrats do Vastly Better
- STDs: Chlamydia (Gonorrhea) - Democrats do Clearly (Vastly) Better
- Adult Obesity. - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Hypertension Mortality - Democrats do Vastly Better

### Child Welfare

- Infant Mortality - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Teen Births - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Divorce - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Household Food Insecurity - Democrats do Vastly Better
- Population Graduated from High School - Democrats do Slightly Better
- Child Poverty - Democrats do Vastly Better

[You can read the original article showing these statistics here.](https://appliedsentience.com/2020/08/02/summary-of-23-quality-of-life-indicators-are-red-or-blue-states-better/)

But *still*, the narrative warfare played out in the media is that Republicans have a better handle on EVERYTHING in their states, and Democratic-run states are sinking hellholes full of aborted fetuses created by drug-fueled rapists.

Which, to be honest, sounds a lot like Colonizer Projection.

## Colonizer Roots and Colonizer Future

One of the prime ways that colonizers conquered a land region is by overthrowing the indigenous language and culture. Also, any good (meaning usable) ideas were promptly assimilated and exported back to the Mother Country (usually the United Kingdom but Spain was not far behind).

Raping women and creating shadow families was also a part of the deal. If you could "breed out" the native population, then you can sow division more easily by creating a form of "bloodline mistrust". These shadow families are unrecognized in the official histories of either the Imperial records or the indigenous records.

Practicing environmental genocide (what we euphemistically call "terraforming") is another way to literally "conquer the land". Clear-cutting forests for imperial wood (which is something we are STILL doing in the Amazon rainforest) is a thing, and that thing causes mass extinctions of species of animals, flora and fauna, and along with it potential carbon sinks that could have mitigated our CO2-emitting culture.

Lastly, the land itself is just straight-up seized and because of fungible personhood, colonizers basically act like the land just pre-existed and was there for the taking because NO HUMAN was already there. Just a bunch of savages. Whose females were raped and breeded in order to erase said-savages. A version of this story is in any honest history of the Native American genocide during the 17th-19th centuries.

Basically, the colonizer playbook comes down to "erasing the conquered's past to guarantee the conqueror's future". And there's a variation of this that plays out today. Let's get into it.

## Lying about History

There's A LOT of different "birth dates" for America. Here's some of the more famous ones (which may or may not be rigorously "accurate"):

- 1492: Columbus discovers the Americas
- 1619: The first slave ship lands in Jamestown
- 1776: The Declaration of Independence was written and proclaimed
- 1777: The Articles of Confederation were drawn up
- 1781: The Articles of Confederation were unanimously ratified
- 1787: The current United States Constitution was written
- 1789: The Constitution was ratified

A date that's missing from this list is 1783, when the Treaty of Paris was formally signed *recognizing* the United States' existence as a sovereign nation between representatives of Great Britain and the newly liberated colonies. There were also separate peace treaties signed between Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic concluding a long World War, of which the American Colonies were perhaps the largest battlefield. A lot of land changed hands during that time, of which the former American colonies were just a PART of the conclusion of a large World War between the four empires.

### The Great Myth at the Heart of the American Revolution

The great myth at the epicenter of the American Revolution is that the Americans, by way of a massively underfunded and under-armored Continental Army, somehow got lucky and plucky over and over and over again and defeated the world's preeminent military, the British Imperial Army and Navy, by itself with a very late and very light assist from the French Imperial military.

That idea COULD NOT BE ANY LESS TRUE. The Continental Army could barely afford its supplies since the Continental Congress could not tax its citizens and had to issue payments in the form of bonds, or debtor notes. The whole fight about the national debt that happened much later in George Washington's first term was about this very debt.

In the mean time, the Continental Army's soldiers barely got paid once a year and were massively under-armored in its supplies. And somehow they were destined to defeat the British, the world's greatest military?

Nope.

[The efforts of Silas Deane and then Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War#French_involvement) to convince the Kingdom of France to commit to supporting and then allying with the American war effort was the decisive political, economic and military factor that enabled the eventual military defeat of the British Army.

Once the French Army showed up militarily and not just logistically, George Washington was functionally sidelined from the war effort. He even complained how little command action he was getting because the French had so thoroughly taken up the war effort to defeat the British. At some point the Spanish and the Dutch empires got involved as well, which is what enabled the liberation of the colonies from the British and the eventual Treaty of Paris and its various side treaties.

And yet NO ONE asks WHY, if the Americans **militarily won** the American Revolution, why was the victory treaty negotiated in Paris instead of New York?

Maybe because France's actual role was minimized and erased in the narrative warfare of the American Revolution?

### History rhyming again and again

A version of the same "erasure of the record" happened after the Civil War. Even if the South was militarily and economically defeated at the end of the Civil War, a continuing rear-guard action happens to this very day.

By exploiting a loophole in the 13th Amendment, both public and private prisons can exploit prisoners to engage in uncompensated or incredibly cheap labor for American corporations.

Also, when Reconstruction formally ended in 1877 as part of the settlement of the Presidential election of 1876, the South began an open and public campaign of terrorism against the formerly enslaved populations. This is what the Jim Crow era was about. While it is true that there has been *some* progress in the South since the Civil Rights Movement's heyday in the 1960s, the right to vote still does not exist as a positive right and nearly every Southern states employ legislatively sanctioned voter suppression tactics to disenfranchise as many people as possible, especially ethnic minorities as well as women.

Given that the Sons and Daughters of the Rebellion completely took over the Republican Party, the party that originally defeated the Confederate government in the War of the Rebellion, I'd venture to say that the South "won" the narrative version of the Civil War through some mixture of physical, narrative, and legislative warfare. Especially AFTER it lost the first round militarily.

## More White Male-washing of History

It's a good bet to assume that almost every major historical event, discovery or movement had women, indigenous populations, and ethnic minorities at or near the epicenter of the story. And because White Dudes have usually controlled the narrative, they take it upon themselves to erase the indigenous, the ethnic minorities, and women out of those same stories. One form of this is known as the "Great Man" theory of History.

But really, think of it as Narrative Colonization.

For example, in the Oppenheimer movie that won Best Picture in 2024 and was written and directed by Christopher Nolan, there's ZERO mention of how the Federal Government used a brutal form of Eminent Domain to seize the lands of the Hispanic and Native American peoples that were already at Los Alamos in order to set up the temp city housing the Manhattan Project.

The same thing happened with computer technology.

While it is *true* that Alan Turing and John von Neumann contributed A LOT to the theoretical underpinnings of the computing device, what is OFTEN left out of any history is the story of how Adm. Grace Hopper invented the first compiler which is used to translate source code to assembly. Without that SINGLE invention, there would really be NO software development. We'd still be using some weird mixture of punch cards and switch configuration to program computers, and the technology you're reading this on wouldn't be possible. She also contributed to an ancestor language to COBOL, one of the first human-readable programming languages. But most software developers have no idea who she is and what she contributed to computer science.

Also, unless you've read or watched *Hidden Figures*, you likely have NO idea that African-American women pioneered the orbital mathematics and computational work that enabled NASA to put John Glenn into orbit. In fact, the term "computers" used to be the job description for the women who did the raw number-crunching for NASA. When the term was appropriated for the machine class we now call computers, the African-American women who held those roles were erased from NASA's popular history as the government focused on the Space Race with the Soviet Union and celebrating the "heroism" of the astronauts who never would have gotten into orbit, much less the moon, without the mathematical prowess of the African-American women pioneering the orbital mechanics and equations and the technology to do the vast amount of number-crunching needed for each mission. The African-American women who used to ***be*** computers graduated to *programming* computers.

Apple contributed to this erasure trend as well. [During the Apple II era in the late 1970s, Apple's advertising portrayed the users of its hardware as primarily male hobbyists and office workers.](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding) It's almost certainly true that some mixture of Steve Jobs, Mike Markulla and Regis McKenna shaped the brand advertising to cater exclusively to male hobbyists, office workers and fathers and sons, thereby reinforcing public perceptions that computer science was a male-only career path and that women and ethnic minorities like African Americans and Native Americans need not apply.

Again, modern colonization may not involve classical genocide. It just could be repurposed "narrative genocide".

# Ways to Think About How the Past Fights the Future

## Doing nothing is always better than doing something

"Conservatism" in all its various forms argues for slow-rolling progress or making sure society does as little as possible to preserve norms and traditions from the past. There's often some argument about how "too much change too soon" will destabilize "society". And by "society", conservatives mean the status quo of unchallengeable oligarchic power. Because if "doing nothing" is carried out, the oligarchs get to stay happy and won't raise a fuss, right?

## Avoiding structural change at all costs

There are SOOOOO many examples of this. But one egregious example is the 700 failed attempts to reform or eliminate the electoral college. It's nearly UNIVERSALLY agreed to be such a bad idea that no other democracy has copied since its U.S. inception in 1787. In fact, it's only defenders are small state politicians who openly say it's the only way small state politicians have a chance to get elected President.

The impossibility-to-date of reforming the electoral college is a function of the supermajority threshold to amend the Constitution. The way it's ALWAYS done to date is to get 2/3rds of both the House (288 Representatives) and the Senate (67 Senators) to propose (in essence, "vote out of committee") an amendment. After that, 3/4th of the states (38 legislatures) have to ratify the amendment. Sometimes that can be a simple majority vote in both houses, and sometimes it can be a supermajority vote in both houses (either 3/5th or 2/3rds of the legislators).

And then sometimes it really doesn't matter anyway what an amendment says, right? SCOTUS decided on March 4, 2024 that former President Trump, who was impeached for "incitement of insurrection", could remain on the Colorado presidential ballot. This was ***IN SPITE OF*** the fact that Section 3 reads as follows (this was adopted on July 9, 1868 in the wake of the War of the Rebellion):

>Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

Now, there have been some *howlers of incredulity* as to the Trump attorneys' arguments about why Trump should NOT be disqualified (one was that the President **IS NOT** an officer of the United States). Even though SCOTUS voted 9-0 as to why Trump should remain on the ballot, and that unanimity glossed over A LOT of dissent as to the "why he should remain", the pertinent fact here IS NOT that the plain text of the amendment was nullified and Section 3 was disemboweled. The pertinent fact here is that there was NOTHING about the plain text of this section that mattered to this SCOTUS. What I mean is that if SCOTUS wants to find a way to say "red" is "blue", or "grounds for disqualification" are now "not grounds for disqualification", then who cares what the Constitution or the Amendments say? Because after all, whatever SCOTUS says, that IS the Constitution.

And as a BONUS, SCOTUS had 3 Justices appointed by Trump and 1 Justice appointed by Biden. So 4 judges had HOPELESS conflicts of interest with regards to the 2024 election and yet they decided anyway. And there's NO WAY to structurally fix THAT.

## The "Don't Tell Me What To Do" crowd

Conservatives like to scream about how "Big Government" is trampling their rights and that they shouldn't have to conform to any legislatively- or executive-mandated coercion.

The oligarchs USE these people (almost always White Evangelical Christians) as a way to get out of submitting to A LOT of regulation that is beneficial to the population as a mass group. Things like mass vaccinations during the first years of the COVID-19 crisis, or environmental regulations, or the current litigation around mifespristone, a drug that can medically induce abortions.

And of course, everyone's favorite: gun control to prevent mass shootings. According to the Gun Violence Archive, [there were 656 mass shootings in 2023](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting?year=2023). We are BY FAR the most [armed-per-capita country on the planet](https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting), and as a result we have the most gun violence, both fatal and non-fatal. We have approximately 120.5 guns per 100 residents. As a consequence of that level of gun armor, we also have 120 Americans die from some type of gun violence. And yet the "Good Guy with a Gun beats a Bad Guy with a Gun" narrative still captures the imagination of (mostly) conservative rural whites. Also, in the most recent famous mass shooting at the Kansas City parade celebrating the Super Bowl victory of the Kansas City Chiefs, there were [more than 850 police officers](https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article285539852.html) present from both Kansas City police departments (both Kansas and Missouri), the Kansas State Police and the FBI.

I personally have TWO favorite parts of this story to show the absurdity of the dominant "guns don't kill people, people kill people" narrative:

1. Stacey Graves, The Kansas City, Missouri police chief, refused to answer any questions about what could be done to have prevented this particular mass shooting. (FYI: The correct answer is always going to be "fewer guns" every single time this question is asked.)
2. There were approximately EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY trained law enforcement professionals AND YET somehow the presence of mass law enforcement DID NOT DETER the shooters from starting another mass shooting event.

But IF we as a society through our legislative bodies ever suggest doing ANYTHING about it, the "Church of the Gun" worshippers start screaming and making death threats to our legislators and law enforcement professionals for *doing their job to protect society in the large*.

So far, as a sampler, the "Don't Tell Me What To Do" crowd keeps the oligarchs in power by:

- Fighting public health measures like vaccine mandates and gun control
- Screaming about the "Lie from the Pit of Hell" about the Climate Crisis
- Staying in a tizzy with their "Forced Birth" position
- Keeping the American Caste system in place through racism, misogyny, homophobia, ableism, sexual orientation, class, geography, taxation, etc.

There are others, but I'm just focusing on this batch here.

All of these divisions are designed to prevent us as a society from focusing on taxing, regulating, and limiting oligarchs in their economic and political power in order to provide for the common welfare. That's why this stuff happens and keeps happening.

Go back and look at the James Madison quote at the top of the essay and then come back. I'll wait.

## The Death of Hope and Faith

Another part of the whole point of this [enshittification of America](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) is that it leaves enough Americans in a state of coerced-divided-and-conquered helplessness.

If you'll indulge a bit of a generalization, I'll explain:

Red state voters have measurably WORSE outcomes for the vast majority of what I'm going to call "common welfare issues": public health, economic growth, crime, high school graduations per capita, etc. And yet they are LIED TO constantly about how great they are doing compared to the, ahem, *urban shithole cities* that Fox News, Sinclair Broadcasting, and other right-wing media keeps pumping them through some mix of white male and white female talent (with "token" minority talent) to keep reassuring them that they don't have to change and that their job is to oppose all social changes from the outside world. So they keep re-hiring the same not-exactly-incompetent Republican state and federal legislators cycle after cycle, and things KEEP. GETTING. WORSE.

Rural White Voters keep re-upping on being betrayed by their Republican Representatives and then reinforcement-coddled in their victimhood. The canonical descriptor about this and the ensuing controversy came by way of Barack Obama in April 2008 when he attended a fundraiser and remarked about struggling small-town voters: "They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."

There were a number of problems with this quote aka "gaffe":

- It spoke an INCONVENIENT TRUTH that should never be publicly disclosed
- Hillary Clinton's counter-attack on Obama as response to the quote reinforced the status quo

What is the status quo? I'm glad you asked!

The status quo contract between political elites and rural voters is to emotionally pander to them and never challenge them to confront themselves and grow and change in exchange for their votes, or at the very least, their tacit consent to not engage in some form of armed rebellion. In exchange, [state and federal politicians get to keep transferring taxes and educational and business opportunities OUT OF Rural America and lie to them about it](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593729145). More simply, Republican state and federal legislators exclusively pander to their constituents religiously, but not economically. And then they turn around and transfer THEIR tax dollars to their wealthiest donors and write economic policies that exclusively favor same donors.

That's [the whole point of the American Legislative Exchange Council aka ALEC](https://www.alecexposed.org/wiki/ALEC_Exposed). Think of ALEC as a sister organization to the Federalist Society.

So that's A LOT of detail, and I can almost feel your eyes bleeding as you experience a strong case of [tl;dr syndrome](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/TLDR). So, let me simplify and generalize this even further:

- Rural White Voters get to keep their childhood God, who always looks like some version of [White Jesus](https://youtu.be/dfJCyDmTwyg)
- Because they are UTTERLY surrounded by other rural white people almost exclusively, they have a homogenous mindset reinforced by church attendance and "Friday Night Lights" football games. This homogeneity has roughly two points of origin:
	- Original government policies ONLY allowing White Men to own land at the time of the Constitution's inception (esp. in the South) as well as Jim Crow terrorism cowing African-Americans into fleeing (aka [The Great Migration](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679763880))
	- Continous policies of segregation, whether it was explicitly racial (Jim Crow and its antecedants) or [economic in the modern era](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525577335). Bonus points if you already knew that it happens EVERYWHERE and not just in the South.
- These same White Voters listen to AM Radio, Fox News, Sinclair Broadcasting stations, and right wing social media posts shared by their friends and family all the time. These groups are ***constantly*** self-reinforcing their programming that "ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM US IS BAD".
- This is why any appeals based on "cultural security" can easily exploit them, even if the appeals are demonstrably untrue.
- Any argument that *challenges* their built-in victim posture, which they have to adapt in order to preserve their self-esteem driven need for cultural security, will be automatically dessicated and rejected.

Why? Because the addictive need to be right about my/your/our past keeps us in a self-reinforcing feedback loop of self-victimization. The Loop sounds or feels like a version of this:

1. My small town is losing economic opportunity
2. Everyone I listen to tell me it's the government's fault
3. I keep electing Republicans to represent ME at the state and federal levels and my Republican Party dominates the state legislature (because Democrats are the party of Bad Government and Republicans are the Party of NO government) because it makes me feel good to "stick it to those gay communist libruls in the Democrat Party"
4. Go to Step 1

However, BEHIND MY BACK, my Republican state and federal legislators pass laws to transfer tax money out of my city, county and state and into the hands of their corporate sponsors and donors that fund ALEC. They also write laws and policies to create economically negative impact policies towards me and my community to keep me angry so that I'll keep feeling like a victim. And they'll blame Democrats for my problems even though I'm the one who voted for the Republicans who did this to me. And I'll believe the Republican politicians only because everyone around me agrees with them AND Fox News is reinforcing that I'm always going to be a victim of the Democrat Party.

Alright, so I can still feel your eyes bleeding. Sorry. At this point you're going to have to work a little bit for that 4-step process or for the "BEHIND MY BACK" paragraph to make sense until the next revision of this essay.

The bottom line: it's all about quietly creating *enshittification* for rural voters to keep them locked in to voting Republican and reinforcing support for the oligarchs. That's how hope and faith get twisted and co-opted. Because if "White Jesus" disapproves of that evil white man-hating Democrat party, and you vote against the Dems and vote for the Republicans, and things **GET WORSE**, then your **Victory in Jesus** becomes even more promised, because you can't NEVER EVER EVER admit that you made a mistake because if you're wrong, than the White Supremacist Christianity you practice might also have some problems, too. And because of the [Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy), you'd rather die, abuse / be abused by your spouse, abuse your children, take opioids to numb the pain, and listen to White Supremacist Preachers invite you to the alter for the 1,000th time to recommit to White Jesus then actually [giving up patriarchy](https://bellhooksbooks.com/product/the-will-to-change/), reclaiming your life force energy, and making different choices.

## The Metric System

So as it turns out, Thomas Jefferson, when he was the FIRST Secretary of State, was introduced to the still-in-draft-form of the metric system as far back as 1790. The metric system wasn't finalized until 1799, just in time for Jefferson's first presidential campaign in 1800.

And yet he took a pass on it, instead choosing the past of least resistance: sticking with the British Imperial System. Our very non-standard ways of measuring things based on the British Empire won out. There was an extremely half-hearted effort passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Pres. Gerald Ford calling for ["the voluntary conversion to the metric system."](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18693533/metric-system-measurement-us-conversion-act-verge-science)

And because it's voluntary, nothing will ever happen in relationship to that Act. Or us getting with the goddamn program the rest of the planet is on. And every so often, [we'll have stupid shit like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Project_costs) that costed around HALF A BILLION DOLLARS adjusted for inflation.

Thanks, TJ.

***Jackass.***

## Land is More Important than People

A **LOT** of what keeps all this stuff locked into place is that land (and specifically the *wha has ownership and representation* of the land) is considered more important than the people themselves.

It'll get explicated later, but the core idea is that the Framers very specifically INTENDED (as a part of their (and our) Devil's Bargain) is to give rural states where ***FAR FEWER*** people lived a vetocratic superpower over the more populous states where more people lived. Think of this as a rural state hegemony. One way it showed up as an example was when "Dakota" was signed into law as two states, North AND South Dakota, on November 2, 1889. This new statem membership moment increase the Republican caucus count in the U.S. Senate to +4.

This was at a time where the State of New York was considered the "Super State". In 1787, it had the financial capital of the young country (Wall Street) as well as the political capital of the young country.

I haven't found YET the records of a usable census and their population counts for the year 1787. [Here's what I could find](https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/colonialbostonpops.pdf) based on the first published Census count from 1790:

1. Virginia: 747,610
2. Pennsylvania: 434,373
3. North Carolina: 395,005
4. Massachusetts: 378,556
5. New York: 340,241
6. Maryland: 319,728
7. South Carolina: 249,073
8. Connecticut: 237,655
9. New Hampshire: 141,899
10. Vermont: 85,341
11. Georgia: 82,548
12. Rhode Island: 69,112
13. Delaware: 50,046

So, a FEW NOTES about this list:

ONE: Vermont's town and village populations weren't even explictly counted or broken out of the New York state census until the first Federal Census in 1790. So using a retcon-level numerical thought experiment, New York would have vaulted from \#5 to \#3 in terms of being in the "Big 3" for population count == influence.

TWO: These census takers didn't always play by the same uniform rules in terms of who counted and who didn't during the taking of the census pre-Constitution. Native Americans and slaves were counted or not counted arbitrarily. Basically, not everyone counted equally, which is very on-brand.

THREE: Because of the 3/5th count of slaves collectively agreed on in 1787, it's POSSIBLE that the counts are off ANYWAY because of that one fact alone. Slave states wanted full **COUNTING** advantage during censuses, but the Framers collectively and explicitly agreed that women and slaves **SHOULD NOT GET** representational proportionality at the decision table. Ergo, it's quite possible that these counts are off.

FOUR: The NORTH wanted the slave counts to be ZEROED out because they wanted the South to have as little representative power as possible. The South wanted the full count of slaves to appear in the census BUT they didn't want to ACTUALLY represent them or give them political power. Shady.

This shows up in other ways, too, and will be covered in this and other essays. The core ideas

## Oligarchs Today! Oligarchs Tomorrow! Oligarchs Forever!

OK so if you think deeply about it for more than a few minutes, it's doubtful that any framers who participated in drawing up the Constitution were actually middle-class people. None were women, indigineous, or black. Why is that?

If you had to WORK for a living, how could you afford to take the summer of 1787 ***OFF*** so that you could participate in re-architecting the national government of the country to something functionally stronger than the structure provided in the Articles of Confederation? You had to be participating REGULARLY in the central political conversations or connected to the White Dudes who WERE participating in those conversations. You also had to have enough financial resources to have a STAKE in how the country governed itself.

In essence, you were an oligarch. And your buddies were oligarchs. And THIS is what you collectively thought:

>The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. *The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.* 

(From the opening quote attributed to James Madison.)

The core idea, the main idea, the ***first idea*** is to make sure that the government is consciously **architected and designed** to protect the rights of property owners. Thus spoketh James Madison, a future POTUS.

Let's just be SUPER-CLEAR here: almost 50% of these White Dudes INHERITED their property: slaves and land and all that. "Not all Framers" sounds pretty damning.

## Cultural Appropriation, Credit-Stealing and Inspiration-Negation

Because they really did view themselves as having a kinder and gentler version of megalomania, they really thought EVERYTHING was theirs. Especially Pets and their work-product.

As a result, the Framers and the White Dudes who followed them had ZERO problems with cultural appropriation. One of the progenitor acts of cultural appropriation was using some of the ideas of Native Americans' Constitutions. [The Constitution of the Iriquois Confederacy](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/MOD/iroquois.asp) is one such document.

This would happen so often as to no longer be remarked on. Colonialism's practice of cultural theft was so widespread and so common as to become not even worth mentioning in the White version of American history. The most that happens in a number of American History textbooks is a paragraph or two mentioning the Trail of Tears and possibly a chapter section on the many battles between the U.S. Army and the various Native American nations as a part of the genocidal wars that had to be waged in order to fulfill on Manifest Destiny.

No doubt Thomas Jefferson reflected and contributed to the contemporary views of the Framers toward the Indigineous:

>[George III] has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, **the merciless Indian savages** whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.

\-The Declaration of Independence, the 27th Grievance

As usual, like many many things when it comes to the Framers, [it was about the money.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/americas-twofold-original-sin/606163/) About 10 years before the Revolutionary War started, George Washington (among others colonial elites) engaged in land speculation. They were counting on the British Crown's edict that there would be no settlements west of Appalachia in order to honor a peace treaty between England and the native populations. Washington very much WANTED that land and he DIDN'T CARE how he was going to get access to it and convert his land use investment.

I mention all this because there is VERY LITTLE about the Constution or the various "birth events" of America in its original form that had anything to do with patriotic idealism. It was about cheap labor and stealing lands through genocide. It's there in the fine print of the 27th Grievance: "insurrections" refer to any slaves who join the British military to collect on George III's promise to free any slaves who help put down the rebellion aka the American Revolution. It's also about declaring that the colonists were attempting to overthrow English rule in order to have purchase over all the lands west of Appalachia. 

Why? For. The. Land. And. The. Money.

This is a fundamental and almost utterly overlooked premise in almost all versions of American history taught at every level of the American education system: the oligarch framers of the Constitution (the ones with any real power, anyway) were interested in permanently concentrating economic and political power in their hands FOREVER no matter how much the country changed.

"We the People" really only defined "People" to mean the Rich White Dudes in the room and their peers. In modern terms, "People-hood" means Rich White Dudes with a net worth of at least USD $100M. Why am I using a net worth that high? Because those kinds of people will automatically be granted all kinds of privileges, exceptions, exemptions, resources and societal benefits-of-the-doubt economically, socially and politically. Rich White Dudes are often granted press and a listening that "takes them seriously" in subject domains that are WAY WAY WAY outside of their lanes. They are often lobbed softball questions in interviews. They don't have to deal with the double standard of being labeled a "bitch" if they have ambition oract aggressively. If they want to take a chance to do something new, it's totally encouraged and celebrated.

[White men represent over 93% of MANAGEMENT of Venture Capital dollars.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethedwards/2021/02/24/check-your-stats-the-lack-of-diversity-in-venture-capital-is-worse-than-it-looks/) Decision-makers are where the ACTUAL power to deploy capital actually lies. And VC money is nothing if not about decision-making. Who gets "green lit" to take a risk at-scale. What's wild is that two-thirds of the money that makes up the $40 TRILLION of Assets Under Management are coming from widows aka "the women-folk".

Why is this important? Because whoever has the gold makes the rules. That's why it's called "the Golden Rule" and not some nonsense about "doing unto others" that a homeless dude from Nazareth who was white-washed to look like a Venice Beach bum spouted off on the side of some hill.

# Founding Fathers and Their Mediocrity

## Competition is For Losers

Using an idea that would be pioneered hundreds of years in the future by Peter Thiel, ["competition is for losers"](https://youtu.be/3Fx5Q8xGU8k), the Framers thought to build-in massive lock-in for their preogatives in the architecture of the government and society. Why? **TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY FROM BEING TAKEN FROM THEM.**

Never mind that they almost uniformly either inherited, married into, stole, or subjugated *said property*. This is an exploration of "Framer-washing", where the actual intentions are expressed through the political architecture of the American government.

In this essay, and the others, we're exploring **EXACTLY HOW** the Framers locked in this "first mover" advantage while no one else could. And how they created a tension between the twin original sins of slavery and native genocide to build in a self-destruct mechanism where if the oligarchs and their descendents couldn't keep unfettered economic and political power forever, they would do their best to destroy the country and the planet rather than give up power.

How?

## Enshittification, Theology of Torpidity and Mass Shootings

So every time there's a mass shooting, Republicans and their oligarchic sponsors do this ritual where they reflexively offer ["thoughts and prayers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_and_prayers) after a mass shooting event that gains significant press attention.

America's [gun violence problem is **UNIQUE**](https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting) in the developed world: every other country has vastly stricter gun control policies that dramatically limit the ability of its citizens to acquire firearms. And these laws have almost completely extinguished mass shootings in those countries.

Because [the purpose of a system is what it does (POSWID)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does), the National Rifle Association and its sympathetic Republican politicians have decided that its official policy is to make America unsafer by the day wherever Republicans can achieve control over the political or legal machinery.

This policy of "unsafer by the day" is a process we've already referred to as [*enshittification*](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/). That's the GOP platform and has been in one way or the other since 1981, when St. Ronald Reagan ascended to the White House.

Its twin policy is the theology of torpidity. [Torpor)(https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Torpor) is defined as "a state of physical or mental inactivity; lethargy." The answer that always comes from "thoughts and prayers" is to do **NOTHING**.

This "theology of torpidity" reminds me of the prophets of Baal challenging the efficacy of Yahweh (the name of the Judeo-Christian God) to a ["barbeque-off" with Elijah](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings+18&version=NIV). Essentially, the 50 prophets of Baal attempted to summon the power of Baal to burn up the slaughtered bull on the altar from morning to noon (don't ask... just read the passage if you want the backstory). After failing, Elijah did a little drowning ritual to make sure his altar sacrifice would not *accidentally* catch fire, and then he prayed to Yahweh to "let it be known" that He was God and then fire came down immediately from heaven and destroyed the bull and the altar itself.

The [opening of the Ark of the Covenant](https://youtu.be/N5jBa6RH11g?t=193) at the end of *Raiders of the Lost Ark* gets close to capturing the vibe of what it's like to call down fire from heaven.

Never thought I'd say this, but it looks like evangelicals and Republicans are Baal-worshippers because of their theology of torpidity.

## Environmental Apocalypse

So there's a guy named Frank Luntz who coined the term "climate change" back in the 90s to help Republican politicians, lobbyists and policy-makers avoid sounding alarmist when describing "global warming".

[It's something he regrets](https://grist.org/politics/the-gops-most-famous-messaging-strategist-calls-for-climate-action/), especially since his Los Angeles home has faced the ravages of climate crisis-induced wildfires.

However, his meme contributes to the Theology of Torpidity. Republican politicians still attempt to hold the line on doing NOTHING or calling the climate crisis a hoax even as hundreds or thousands of species go extinct each day and the crisis makes the Southern hemisphere uninhabitable.

A lot of left-leaning Americans are experiencing deaths of despair from climate anxiety.

## The Opioid Epidemic

A lot of what contributes to White deaths-of-despair is the opioid epidemic, which has claimed roughly 650,000 American lives since 1999. Because many of these opioid deaths happen in "Red states", Republican policians are willing to do more than just "think and pray" as they have sued Purdue Pharma into the ground.

A lot of Americans in red states are experiencing deaths of despair from the opioid epidemic. And weirdly, it's the one thing that has pushed Republican Attorneys General to litigate the Sackler family sorta-kinda into the ground. Again, the lawyers for the oligarchic Sackler family have managed to only settle for the interest on their fortune, not the principal. So the "justice system" is working as designed: oligarchs get justice, and the pets get pennies on the dollar.

## A Radical Idea

By doing nothing, the GOP are causing the immigration crisis: [BIPOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color#BIPOC) from the South are fleeing north to America in order to just be able to live. And Donald Trump sabotaged an immigration deal in the Senate back in the Spring of 2024 in order to campaign on an issue that he knew his base would believe whatever he said to them about it.

And because immigrating BIPOCs are fleeing north to America, Whites are experiencing ["deaths of despair"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100449) because of the imminent [browning of America](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/7/30/17505406/trump-obama-race-politics-immigration).

It would be WILD to make the racist case for solving the climate crisis by putting BIPOC climates-of-origin (and the planet) back on a path for sustainability. By doing this Republicans could entice BIPOC immigrants to return back to their homelands and take concrete measures to "keep America White". (Not advocating this as official policy... just thinking out loud...)

Maybe White America would stop taking opioids if they knew brown people weren't invading America at the border?

# Use and Betray, Use and Betray

## J. Robert Oppenheimer

In the academy-award winning film Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan collaborated with Cillian Murphy to portray a patriotic Jewish physicist who had the intellectual and political chops to lead the ultimate physics team (sans Albert Einstein) in the desert of Los Alamos to develop and test the atomic bomb and usher in the nuclear age and the 20th century's most prominent threat of self-destruction by nuclear war. (Never mind that the man-made carbon emission trends were already underway to create global warming. This was kicked off by the first Industrial Revolution from 1800-1870.)

After Oppenheimer's success, he was rejected by Truman as a voice at the table and later betrayed by Lewis Strauss (SUPRISE: a conservative Republican) when Strauss engineered the security hearing that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance one day before it was to expire. This action shredded his reputation and ended his career at the Atomic Energy Commission and his ability to "be in the room" and influence atomic weapons policy.

The government used him to achieve its ends of winning the war. And it was conservatives who turned on Oppenheimer and betrayed him for standing in their way.

*Use and Betray. Use and Betray.*

## Black Military Veterans

Black soldiers fought in World War 2 and contributed substantially to America winning that war. However, when they came home, they were subjected to:

- Jim Crow laws
- Enforced segregation
- Redlining
- Exclusion from GI Bill benefits
- Continued enforcement of anti-miscegenation (interracial marriage) laws
- Employment discrimination
- Education discrimination (including white rebellion against Brown v. Board of Education)
- Housing discrimination in the form of pricing, loan interest rates, loan approval rates, etc
- Domestic terrorism

I think you get the idea.

Basically, the government drafted Black citizens, trained, armed and directed them into war, they DID THEIR FUCKING JOB and then the goverment turned around and said "Thanks now go back to your hole, darkie, and GO FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF."

This is something that's still continuing with the banning of African-American authored books in Republican-controlled states, just as opening table stakes.

*Use and Betray. Use and Betray.*

## Women

Do I even need to write this?

I guess I do.

There are literally THOUSANDS OF BOOKS about this issue. But since we're no longer (if we ever were) a nation of readers, I'm going to cite ONLY one book, [Holding it Together by Jessica Calarco](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593538129). And one election.

*Holding it Together* is a book about the vast amount of unpaid labor contributed by women because of America's shredded social safety net. It describes "a systematic agreement to dismantle our country's social safety net and persuade citizens to accept precarity while women bear the brunt. She leads us to see women's labor as the reason we've gone so long without the support systems that our peer nations take for granted, and how women’s work maintains the illusion that we don't need a net." (from the Publisher's own book summary).

Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic Presidential nominee, actually performed caregiving for her mother as she was dying of breast cancer. So she knew better than most people where the policy gaps were in the social safety net.

And we know how that election turned out. Because of patriarchy-manipulated fears of inflation (which was already coming down by Election Day) and a woman in the highest office in the land (because patriarchy is America's true religion), Americans (notably white women) voted to return Donald Trump to the White House and supercharge the shredding of the social safety net (along with almost everything else).

In case it's still not clear: America uses women in lieu of a formal social safety net. Subsequently and concurrently, America betrays women.

*Use and Betray. Use and Betray.*

## Children and the Climate Crisis

### (child population) Supply and (corporate economic growth) Demand

[American capitalism needs population growth in order to fund economic growth.](https://jacobin.com/2022/08/capitalism-low-birth-rate-labor-abortion-contraceptives-childcare) If the birth rate falls, labor will eventually get more expensive because there will be fewer people available to hire.

The problem isn't expensive labor. The problem is the ***perception*** that expensive labor leads to reduced population growth. As a result, many right-wing led American corporations are funding the Forced Birth movement in order to coerce higher domestic fertility rates.

OK congratulations! You've now force-birthed A MILLION NEW BABIES.

### But wait, there's more (or more of less)

However, you've just caused women to push these babies out of the womb into a world that is dying from the climate crisis that YOU HAVE CAUSED. All in the name of stock option appreciation for Big Oil executives and other mass transit-reliant companies (I'm looking at you, Amazon).

So... babies are born (often against the fully informed choice of the mother) into a world that is dying.

THAT. YOU. CORPORATE. EXECUTIVE. CAUSED.

Thanks for forcing the birth of more children into a world no one wants to live in and experiences despair-inducing levels of inefficacy from. And if you're one of Elon Musk's 14 children, you could possibly be wondering why Dear Old Dad started off as a maybe-hero of the environmental movement with his mass popularization of electric vehicles and turned into the guy who is helping Donald Trump turbocharge the climate crisis?

Or not, since a lack of self-reflection is usually a feature and not a bug of the various Musk family members.

In any case, American corporate execs funded a forced birth policy regime and then turned around and blocked the goverment from putting in the bare minimum policy framework to make the ONE AND ONLY PLANET we all live on continuously hospitable.

For. Stock. Options.

*Use and Betray. Use and Betray.*

# Creating an Oligarchy pretending to be a Democracy

## Rampant Inequality

Part of how this thing called "Amur-ica" keeps going is by creating a sleight-of-hand around the idea of "democracy". Something to keep in mind was that the Framers had ZERO interest in actually trusting "the people" with actual political power and they baked in as many obstacles as they could think of (in the name of compromise) in order to achieve that end.

From the beginning, the political franchise was presuppositioned on some commitment of "the common good", which, if you're keeping score at home, is super-vague at best, and very corruptible at worst. This is where the concept of "fungible personhood" enters the chat. Here's why:

According to [Charles Beard](https://people.tamu.edu/~b-wood/GovtEcon/Beard.pdf), there were no working class people represented at the Constitutional Convention ("the Convention"). So what was "common" was the financial elites who had the free time to study political economy at a sufficient level to participate.

Think about this very deeply for a minute: almost all of us, to a fault, tend to gravitate to people of similar experiences or backgrounds because that's where we experience emotional and intellectual safety. The elites congregate with elites. The religious congregate with the religious. Labor congregates with labor. Artists congregate with artists. So... it's a consequence that "the common good" is going to be redefined based on the group in question, right? What is "the common good" for the artist is going to VASTLY DIFFER from "the common good" for the wealthy, right?

Naturally, for the wealthy, "the common good" is going to mean "create a system of government that keeps capital and political power in our hands no matter how much the country changes." Period. Full stop. And, if it is true that "if you're not growing, you're dying", then creating and perpetuating a system where rampant inequality is the RULE and NOT THE EXCEPTION is the order of the day.

Not just financially. Also along political, geographic, ethnic, and gender lines. Remember, POSIWID. And patriarchy.

## Concentrating economic, political, and technological power

So this essay has talked quite a bit about concentrating wealth and a little bit about political power. To recap:

### Concentrating economic and political power

It's the Golden Rule, baby! "He who has the gold makes the rules." And from a purely self-interested point-of-view, you're going to wrte the rules of the game to preserve your advantage and hamstring any attempts the structural inequities that keep you in your seat of political and economic power.

### Now, let's talk about concentrating technological power

The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is constitutionally mandated to provide intellectual property protection for all manners of physical and intellectual inventions, with a fixed lifespan for that protection. However, that lifespan keeps getting extended further and further out.

This benefits the holders of the USPTO patents and copyrights because they are PROTECTED from competition and are given legal recourse to litigate any violaters of said protection. Again, rigging the rules to favor the already-winners.

And the already-winners know that they can steal up-and-comers' IP and keep doing that stuff because all they'll be subject to is a fine at best or full renumeration at worst. They also prey upon the little guy's apprehension about filing lawsuits and engaging in litigation to protect what's theirs.

I have no doubt an enterprising reader can research for the dark underbelly of patent protection. Now that we are in the age of Generative Artifificial Intelligence, very little protections are actually afforded to IP holders and creatives if they are not already a large company.

Again, the race to create Artificial General Intelligence is to lock in permanent concentation of economic and political power. This is more of the same.

## Communism! Socialism! Oh My!

Starting with the 1950s, conservatives and aligned business interests started accusing left-wing groups (Democrats, liberals, academics, progressives, etc) with the epithet of "Communism!" and "Socialism!" in order to blunt the emotional resonance of political equality.

Any time any kind of social progress proposed that threatens the entitled order of the political, financial, and corporate elites, some mixture of right-wing sourced epithets is deployed in order to keep the masses of White Voters in their slumber.

This slumber keeps the status quo going and benefits the elites. By demonizing progressivism and liberalism, political conservatives in every era basically shut down any attempt at argument because the status quo benefits them at the expense of the working class.

## Narrative Warfare Tactic: Glorify the Past and The Framers

Another way the elites keep the status quo going is by glorifying the past, the Framers and their place in the narrative order. This is done in order to keep the upper hand in the continuous narrative warfare of "Amur-ica" and its oligarchs against the middle and working classes.

One way (as previously discussed) is the constant repetition of the error that the Americans won the American Revolution. Another is the perpetual celebration of "the Framers in their infinite wisdom" (insert gagging sound here). A third is the glossing over of the genocide of indigineous peoples ("Native Americans") on the way to the fulfilment of "Manifest Destiny". A fifth is allowing the Texas State Board of Education to set statewide standards and become a "bulk buyer" of texts. This incentivizes school textbook publishers to create "Texas-approved" textbooks that are then sold nationwide.

## Competition is for Losers by Peter Thiel

It's a not-exactly-obscure maxim that Thiel expounded upon for [his philosophy of startups](https://www.csun.edu/~vcact00f/497CapStone/Peter%20Thiel_%20Competition%20Is%20for%20Losers%20-%20WSJ.pdf). He believes that startups need to define a market problem that they can uniquely solve and race to capture monopoly status. Once they achieve functional monopoly status, they then need to defend that monopoly at all costs, including the cost of the truth by engaging in deceptive rhetoric to avoid public and regulatory scrutiny. All the while capturing monopoly profits while they enjoy monopoly.

By constructing an oligarchy-pretending-to-be-a-democracy, the Framers achieved Peter Thiel's vision, long before he was even born (you could make an argument that he got it from the Framers, but that's a different conversation).

The core idea behind the Constitution is to guarantee oligarchy-as-democracy no matter who's on the ballot for whatever level of goverment. Part of how that was accomplished is by creating a permanent vetocracy.

# Cancel the Future: Vetocracy through the Six Corruptions

There are six basic corruptions embedded in the Constitution.

## Fungible Personhood

Starting with the 3/5th Compromise, the Framers created a precedent to empower the goverment to define personhood for entire demographics. Also, it made a mockery of the opening line "We the People" by defining down who gets to be a person and who gets political agency.

For the purposes of housekeeping, the 3/5th compromise has no "winners" who look good. The North wanted to ZERO OUT all the slaves from the Census (effectively not count them) in order to maintain its political power. The South wanted to get a FULL COUNT of its slaves, without any responsibilities to their freedom, education, or political agency.

The Framer-Oligarchs also decided that adult women were shut out of the franchise. It's not until the 19th Amendment that white women got the franchise to vote, but much of that movement was predicated on allowing women to politically participate in American White Supremacy.

Of course, the Indigeneous were shut out of the franchise. So were children. And immigrants. One of the curious and often-forgotten facts of White Supremacy in America was that Irish, Polish, and other European non-WASP-y immigrants were treated as sub-human when they arrived here. One of the controversies surrounding Senator John F. Kennedy's run for the Presidency in 1960 was his Irish background, along with his Catholic background. Even after JFK's win the Irish people were still not considered "white".

The book [Caste](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230272) details quite a bit of this issue from different angles when it comes to the made-up notion of "race". We also see this play out in women's health care with the "Fetal Personhood" movement seeking to elevate the "personhood" of the fetus at the expense of the personhood of the impregnated mother (who is relegated to ["fetal host" status](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/oklahoma-host-woman-humphrey/)). You can see both ["The Handmaid's Tale" TV series](https://youtu.be/dVLiDETfx1c) or the ["Zurawski v. Texas" documentary](https://www.zurawskivtexas.com) for what it looks like to have fungible personhood for women.

And of course, American children are considered property today. That's why there are "custody fights" when two married parents get a divorce. They are fighting for "custody" of their joint property. Just think about that one. For a long time.

And somehow, magically, children "stop" being property when they reach the 18th year in America and then they become adults. No more fights about their personhood status... oh wait.

## The United States Senate

The Senate was proposed by the small rural states to avoid being overrun by the larger population states when it came to "proportional representation". Benjamin Franklin brokered this bicameral compromise by basically saying "let's have both!" (meaning both proportional representation in the House and equal represetation in the Senate). As a result, we now live in a "rural state hegemony" where the average rural state voter has roughly 4x the voting power of an urban state voter.

Because the Senate has this weird procedural blocking tool called the filibuster along with "unanimous consent" and a weird slavish devotion to Robert's Rules of Order, any Senator can grind the Senate to a halt on ANYTHING: the confirmation of cabinet members and other presidential appointees, laws, treaty ratifications, committee investigations, whatever. Weirdly, the Filibuster is riddled with "exception loopholes" for various things the majority wanted to get done over the obstruction of the minority. On a side note: Alexander Hamilton warned against the filibuster being a democracy-breaking tool.

The fact that every single law has to be passed THREE TIMES is crazy-making by itself: once in the House of Representatives, once in the Senate, and finally after reconciliation.

All good ideas go to die in the Senate. The whole point of the Senate was to be a "cooling saucer" for hot tea, an idea endorsed by both George Washington and James Madison, our 1st and 4th POTUSes and slaveholders. One of my favorite examples of the Senate being the central oppositional tool to thwart the will of the people (besides stopping Civil Rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s) is what happened in the wake of [the Sandy Hook Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting). The Senate stopped cold both the Manchin-Toomey Amendment to expand background checks and the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013. The Senate enables so much American regulatory capture because it approves all the Presidential cabinet appointees who then turn around and hire industry lobbyists to regulate the industries they used to lobby for.

Between the 6-year terms preventing immediate accountability for strongly-disfavored action and the impermanence of political memory in modern American voting populations (see the damage social media is doing to you, dear voter), the Senate is basically immune to the will of the people. It [usually takes 90% agreement by the non-oligarchic population](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691162425) before anything is attempted legislatively, much less done.

## The Electoral College

How do you know an idea is an extraordinarily bad idea? When no one copies it after you've implemented it.

The only good thing about the Electoral College is its resilience to resisting change. There's been over 700 attempts to fixing the Electoral College, and they have all failed.

The Electoral College serves as another reinforcement for rural state hegemony. During the 2024 campaign, over 95% of campaign stops by the 4 principal candidates were made just to seven swing states:

- Arizona
- Georgia
- Michigan
- Nevada
- North Carolina
- Pennsylvania
- Wisconsin

Originally, the EC was intended to be assigned proportional representation (meaning whoever won a congressional district's plurality vote count won a single EV from the state). However, our guy Thomas Jefferson's own political party (The Democratic-Republicans) changed Virginia's allocation from a district-level winner system to a winner-take-all system in order to secure a decisive advantage against John Adams before the election of 1800.

So yeah, it's a shady system that regularly causes problems and creates more flyover states than even so-called coastal elitest states.

## Lifetime Appointments of Federal Judges

Back when the average life expectancy of men was around the 50-something years old, the typical federal judge tenure was somewhere between 10-15 years.

As of right now, Clarence Thomas has served on the Supreme Court for 34 years. The longest tenure is William O. Douglas, who held the record at 36+ years.

If the current attempts to extend the human lifespan beyond its current average range succeed, it's possible that a future Clarence Thomas could make a run for a 50- or 60-year tenure, as well as other appointees.

Given the Republican propensity to nominate judicial teenagers (federal judges who have little to no experience on the federal bench and who are in their 30s or 40s or early 50s at the oldest), the whole point is to have the SCOTUS be a captured branch of goverment immune to elections or turnover.

## Legislatures Drawing their Own Districts

Every 10 years, there's a census. The decennial census updates the count of citizens in a given state and where they are located. The state legislature is then constitutionally mandated to update its legislative district maps to reflect the current population. As a result, the new maps allow for political realigment.

Haha ... you really think that happens? After the 2010 elections and [Project REDMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REDMAP), the Republicans locked in excessively gerrymandered legislative districts at the state and federal level. There's been complaints since the beginning of [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) (which was named after Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry).

The core corruption is that the legislature basically sets the rules of elections AND each member competes in the election. What could POSSIBLY go wrong?

If this is still not obvious, think about it from the point-of-view of a sports league. Imagine the Philadelphia Eagles (who have just won the Super Bowl in 2025) setting the rules for ALL competitions, all sponsorships, all drafts, all trades, and everything else related economically to the playing of professional football. They also get to set the rules for ALL the other teams. AND they get to set the rules for all TV coverage, all swag wear, all concessions, etc. And they get to do this FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

Is this starting to make sense? Why would ANY OTHER TEAM even bother playing knowing the rules are so thoroughly rigged? The fact that legislatures can draw their own districts AND make laws is just crazy. Even with redistricting commisions, the commisions are structured according to rules ***set by the legislature.***

Is the problem now obvious enough?

[The Political Thicket](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-political-thicket/id1117202653?i=1000370437214) from the "More Perfect" podcast talks about this issue in the "Baker v. Carr" case and how there was really NO clean way to force a state legislature to re-draw its political maps without causing problems. And we are still living with those problems today. It's both a political problem, a census problem, and a separation of powers problem. And it's our problem. And a hot mess.

## Supermajority Threshold for Amendment Codification

Lastly, there's a supermajority threshold for amending the Constution. Basically, you have to get a 2/3rd majority vote out of either (a) both houses of Congress or (b) state legislatures to propose an amendment. Then you have to ratify the amendment by having 3/5th of state legislatures approve the amendment.

This supermajority threshold ignores a functional fact: all you need is a majority opinion from the Supreme Court to declare if something is constitutional or not. That's it.

To legally overturn a controversial SCOTUS opinion will almost always takes DECADES going through the amendment process. If the SCOTUS opinion is corrupt, it will almost certainly stand for a very long time. Some decisions stand for centuries and are never functionally repealed.

These six corruptions are how the Past cancels the Future.

# Always lying and concealing history

## The South Won the Civil War

[American Patriarchy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743456084) pervades every single sentence of the American Constitution. It it the core organizing principle. If you don't believe me, just go back to the opening quote from James Madison at the top of the essay and understand that EVERYONE who wasn't in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia during the Summer of 1787 was considered property of the oligarchs, whether they were formally enslaved in the South, wage-enslaved in the North, or child-enslaved as "women and children".

The fact that the 13th Amendment has a loophole for prison labor being a legal form of slavery should tell you that ultimately, the South won the Civil War both in terms of discourse and in the transformation away from the Southern Plantation as a kind of beautified "prison labor camp" to actual prisons being a more honest form of a "prison labor camp".

Just the fact that there's continued success in the "plantation wedding" industry where former slave labor camps are used as destination wedding sites should tell you A LOT about the fact that the South narratively won the Civil War.

## The French military won the American Revolution

The American Revolution (le sigh). So much mythology to strip away. The biggest myth is that the Americans ***militarily won*** the war with a minor assist from the French.

Not. True.

The Continental Congress could *barely* afford to pay its soldiers in the Continental Army during the run-up to the French intervention (shout-out to Silas Deane and Ben Franklin). Some years they could only pay a meager annual salary and some years they couldn't even do that. That's why the Continental Congress issued promissory notes to the soldiers that eventually became part of the controversy over the National Debt (made famous by Hamilton's [Cabinet Battle #1](https://youtu.be/eYE023CrMo4)).

So ... think about it like this: HOW could the Americans ***afford*** to fight and win the American Revolution against the world's greatest military force (the British Army and Naval Armada), especially when:

- They were continuously having to contend with Loyalists who didn't want to leave the British Empire?
- They couldn't afford to do any kind of fighting beyond guerilla warfare
- They didn't have the type of unified support that the North Vietnamese enjoyed in repelling not one, but two colonial incursions (both the French and the American Empires)
- They didn't have a stable tax base to draw resources from
- They didn't have an organized navy

In war, the better-resourced adversary will always win. This isn't just about money (although that matters A LOT). It also matters in terms of who has popular support on its side, too. Home field advantage matters A LOT. And since the American Revolution was [yet-another world war](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1588346331), the Spanish and the Dutch empires got involved as well in taking down the British Empires a peg.

Just as a final note to this story: after [Ben Franklin's successful diplomatic mission to convince the French to join the Americans](https://youtu.be/YPG4I2jPSRE), George Washington complained in various letters that he had been all-but-sidelined from his own war effort. This complaint is also from the same guy who had to borrow £500 pounds to get to his own first inauguration in 1789 (almost USD$87,000 in 2025).

The (usually broke) Father of our Country couldn't afford to fight his way out of a paper bag. He was literally the luckiest of soldiers.

But because Americas schools of all stripes don't teach actual history, or even the basics of how to "follow the money", every school child is miseducated on exactly who won the American Revolution, and how.

## Lying about Vietnam and Iraq

When it comes to the use of American hard power versus soft power, there's almost always going to be an ethical problem in the initiation of hard power, especially in wars of choice (meaning America is the one launching the first attack).

### Vietnam

So the typical ["casus belli" (cause of war)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli) narrative is that the Johnson Administration claimed [there were TWO attacks on the USS Maddox](https://allthatsinteresting.com/gulf-of-tonkin). The 2nd attack was falsely hyped up as the *casus belli* that suckered Congress into declaring war on North Vietnam and Americans going to war with the North Vietnamese for 10 years, 8 months, and 23 days (August 7, 1964 to April 30, 1975). 

Here's the problem: the French had convinced the U.S. to pick up the tab of defending its colonialism efforts in Vietnam, with both treasure and blood. Under the threat of Communism, the French successfully enlisted multiple American governments as a part of our [Containment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containment) strategy for dealing with the expansion of Communism by way of the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact) and China's political adoption of Communism as well as North Korea (it didn't help our bullshit detector that North Korea had fought the US to a standstill and we are [STILL living under the terms of an armistice agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement)).

Because goverments can't admit they were suckered (especially the American goverment), we escalated to the point of 58,281 American troop deaths and the Vietnamese experienced up to 2-3 million casualties (both military and civilian). It's likely that another 50K-70K Laotians and between 40K-150K Cambodians were killed due to extra-territorial strikes by American bombing campaigns.

Again, this was because the French suckered us into defending its colonial efforts under the guise of "Containment". And then Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson quietly escalated to the point of open war and then Presidents Nixon and Ford kept it going until the US could no longer hold Saigon and were literally run out of town.

Why? Because there are few worse ideas that capture the imagination then colonialism and empire. And that terrible idea is built on a falsehood that your country's resources and people belong to our country's leadership (both political and economic).

### Iraq

For the sake of this essay, I'll go ahead and grant that the first Gulf War in 1991 was justified. It's the second one I want to focus on.

***Before*** the 9/11 attacks that leveled the World Trade Center in New York City and demolished part of the Pentagon as well as crashed Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA, the Bush Administration began war planning against Iraq as far back as January, 2001 shortly after George W. Bush took office.

Bush was just going in a turbo-charged direction that Bill Clinton had established with the [1998 Iraq Liberation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act). (I can almost hear the Republicans reading this part of the essay blaming Bill Clinton for something W. actually did.)

After the 9/11 attacks, the Bush Administration manufactured some flimsy evidence around Iraq's attempts to procure materials for the manufacturing of Weapons of Mass Destruction and also insinuated that Iraq was connected to Al-Qaeda in the 9/11 attacks. Andrew Card pretty much indirectly admitted to a planned marketing-for-war campaign when he said ["you don't introduce new products in August"](https://www.democracynow.org/2002/9/9/headlines/card_from_a_marketing_point_of_view_you_dont_introduce_new_products_in_august).

The evidence was super-flimsy and yet the American people bought it again because of the effectiveness of fear-mongering that the Bush 43 Administration deployed in the wake of 9/11.

Several months after major combat operations ceased, [Bush admitted that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11](https://www.rferl.org/a/1104385.html). So basically the argument was something like "9/11 + WMD = Invade Iraq!" (or something like that).

It's now a given that the pretext for invading Iraq was based on a lie.

Just like Vietnam.

## The American South inspired the Nazis

Isabel Wilkerson discovered in her research for [Caste](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593230272) that the Nazis drew tremendous inspiration for their march to the Holocaust from the American South. Interestingly, *even they* recoiled at the idea of disqualifying an Aryan from "Aryan status" if they had even a single drop of Jewish blood. This was in response to the "single drop" rule that permeated Southern laws and institutions and handicapped mixed race descendants from experiencing racial parity with their white parents.

I'm going to rephase that idea so it sinks in: even the ***Nazis*** thought the American South ***went too far*** when it came to racial purity in their miscegenation laws.

## The Civil War wasn't waged for the reasons you think

There's a metric ton of "kicking up dust" around the reasons for the cause of the Civil War. But before we get into that, let's consider the reason for "incentives" and why there are a lot of incentives around "forgetting / ignoring the past".

### Definition of "incentive"

Incentive - (1) A thing or policy to encourage one to do something; (2) a payment or concession to stimulate greater output or investment.

Why are we even going here? Everyone *knows* the definition of incentive, right? That may be true, but very few public histories of any topic actually delve into the *economic incentives* behind any kind of historical event.

Consider, gentle reader, that almost every history you've EVER read is structurally incomplete and leaves you woefully under-informed. Think of it as being asked to cross a bridge from "The Present" to "The Past" and yet that bridge has ZERO structural support from the base or ground to the structure of the bridge span.

![How American History is actually taught.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ilOgxaqXocxWh-D-hhpffLv3HeBOA1auzBfU3tzFfilGC1WXWzOfz5L5apM-VU9tX0-ZarybQhoOc-zqnnQpfc2M0aBaEBsx2wYkczpHKwkaFgjpE5G5ys9TzR0DFFvVJidGuiPSztAYUhYamdrzp6JX1UQrRQTYQb3DGexSXvgyuq2NZL4LKVyy9tOIgaJ9jLzOVeY3hNYWD21G1J-GXawj1-pb7r8jX9XokfvFUyB9sqc7ys0uzSlWy2dkemijOuJGAWxel2qmTuYbmg48jDfsyW0dJa8olNee8RKXE1MXnppEIFUpBHDqx3Z6hJZfOEukLLsiC8FIfKiJIPNWhyMk1LgYhDAYx8gmkY0UJJQbnBUDGrGMfZH1EtZy=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu "This is how most history is structurally taught in American schools at almost every level and in almost every school.")

Even though we've all heard "Follow the money" to understand how almost all crimes are motivated, we don't follow that maxim when it comes to understanding history. Take, for example, everyone's favorite whipping boy, British Colonialism. [British historians were recruited by the British government to keep propping up domestic support for Colonialism by publishing histories of the UK's civilizing and "doing this for their own good" colonial ambitions.](https://rohanvenkat.substack.com/p/interview-priya-satia-on-the-earnestly)

Bullshit.

British historians were recruited and supported by the Crown and its various derivative tentacles to produce histories that basically morally and spiritually tranquilized various Imperial populations (including its own UK-based civilians) from ever questioning the moral efficacy (much less superiority) of all the colonialism. [Some of these historians were rewarded handsomely, both in reputation and in fortune, for their collusion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Nobel_Prize_in_Literature)

British colonialism was ALWAYS about the money and the resources. As just one example, the British ***pillaged*** the equivalent of $45 TRILLION dollars in labor and resources from India during its 190-year rule of India (both as the British East India Company and later as part of the Empire). During this time, many many historians were enlisted by the British Government to write books and engage in public dialogues about why the British Empire STEALING from India was a good thing. (If you want to read more on this issue, read ["Time's Monster" by Priya Satya](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0141993928).)

Why? Here's the basic outline:

1. Capitalist power wants resources it doesn't have
2. Capitalist power takes shady actions to acquire said resources
3. Capitalist power needs to maintain popular support to be viable
4. Capitalist power engages in long-running propaganda to manufacture consent in order to maintain its legitimacy

Just be with this outline and consider all the histories you think you know that don't have an economic backstory. That's a deliberate choice on the part of our government(s). It's not a conspiracy. It's a negative-space policy.

### A Note Before Returning to the Reasons for the Civil War

Before I get into this, I'd just like to say at this juncture that there's a pattern that seems to happen with some histories that attempt to tell a different narrative as a break from the "conventional wisdom" narrative of a major event or persona.

That pattern is the phenoma of the new narrative being attacked by so-called gatekeepers of the conventional narrative. Think of it as an attempt of *the Past* trying to cancel *the Future*. Usually this takes place in the form of attacking the entire forest (the larger super-point of the new narrative) by hacking away at the trees (attacking certain details as *wrong* or "factually incorrect" from a certain point-of-view).

With any luck, this phenonena will happen with this narrative.

## Back to the Real Reasons for the Civil War

There's so much to cover here. I'll do my best to use a "Follow the Money" approach as much as possible, but don't be suprised when this gets revised as my understanding and conception of the new narrative gets sharpened. Much of this new narrative is contextualized and summarized from ["The Half Has Never Been Told" by Edward E. Baptist](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465049664).

Starting with an organizing premise that slavery was central to American economic development, [it starts to get a bit crazy](https://bradleyahansen.blogspot.com/2018/06/was-slavery-central-to-american.html). There's a "Golden Rule" in politics which is simplest to understand as "He who has the (most) gold makes the rules." That doesn't always hold up every single time, but it's a useful heuristic to understand how this model of American capitalism and American patriarchy works.

Another way of thinking about American slavery is as a form of socioeconomic addiction where "Southern culture" is the addictive behavior and slavery is the drug. Maybe it's true that slavery was economically not-that-large in terms of GDP, but it IS TRUE that Southern political philosophy and behavior as practiced then (and now) is organized around suppressing the political and economic mobility of African-Americans for the political and economic mobility of European Americans.

### The North Colluded with the South

There are no "Good Guys" and "Bad Guys" in the story of pre-Civil War slavery. Every side looks bad because the the Original Sin of slavery morally impacted EVERYONE.

### The 3/5th Compromise

The South wanted to FULLY COUNT its entire slave population but strip them forver of the right to political agency. The North wanted to ZERO the slave population out. And after a ton of argument, the 3/5th Compromise is born.

### Northern financial interests invested in slavery

Banks in New York and other northern cities provided financing for plantation expansion. Also, northern textile mills depended on Southern cotton. Many of these loans were *secured* by using slave bodies as *collateral*.

### Tensions over western expansion

The Kansas-Nebrask Act and the Missouri Compromise were fundamentally about the economic expansion of the slave system because of competition between the free and slave labor systems in Western territories.

As one example, the "Free Soil" movement was ultimately about guarateeing economic opportunity for white men. Remember: white women were relegated to the home and shut out of most economic opportunities. (White women, I hate to break it to you, but you've always been considered 2nd-class citizens even in the North.) That's where the conflict was centered: white men having access to economic opportunities in the territorial expansions of the United States under the guise of "Manifest Destiny".

(Yes, for now we are going to ignore how the Western lands were stolen from the Native American populations through some mixture of genocide and corrupt land dealings between the United States and the various indigenous nations.)

The need for more and more cotton kept exhausting the land, giving an economic impetus for Southern expansion into slave territories, thereby shutting out Free Men and their labor (remember, the only "men" that counted were white men).

### Gonna have to start a whole other essay here

As it turns out, there are THREE books that go into this issue at a NOT-superficial bullshit-depth:

1. "The Half Has Never Been Told" by Edward E. Baptist (2014)
2. "Clashes of Extremes" by Marc Egnal (2010)
3. "The Causes of the Civil War" by Paul Calore (2008)

So... I'm gonna have to leave y'all with a cliffhanger and get back to you on this.

## A Special Note

I'm not sure WHY I need to spell this out here, but it occurs to me that detailing in essay form (and eventually something more compact) the actual reasons for the Civil War will contribute to the audience being disabused of the notion that "the North were the good guys and the South were the bad guys" in this version of American history. And by extension, doing that will empower the musical to cause the audience transformation I hope for it.

To be continued (eventually)....
