    <outline text="Title: Follow the Money"/>
    <outline text="It’s a universal narrative model that’s almost completely ignored"/>
    <outline text="In conventional US History, the colonists rebelled because they didn’t want to pay such high taxes to George III">
      <outline text="This conveniently ignores the fact that the Crown was attempting to pay down the debts ran up during the French and Indian wars to PROTECT the colonists"/>
      <outline text="So… were the Colonists ungrateful pikers who wanted free protection?"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="The oligarchs DON’T want people to pay attention to where the money is going in any particular narrative unless it makes them look good"/>
    <outline text="If the historical narratives don’t have a traceable and explainable financial motivation and sourcing, you basically have a bunch of actors without a motive">
      <outline text="In the real world, very few things happen without some kind of financial motivation kicking things off"/>
      <outline text="People who say money doesn’t rule the world are likely hopelessly naive and easily pliable"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="Gandhi’s non-violence movement was well-financed in order to accomplish what it did"/>
    <outline text="MLK’s Civil Rights era also had to develop alternative financing in order to sidestep the white supremacist control of the financial system"/>
    <outline text="Warfare Narratives">
      <outline text="The current conventional and convenient narrative of the American Revolution and the so-called “American Experiment” is:">
        <outline text="The British Crown spontaneously raised taxes to oppressive levels in the 1760s and early 1770s"/>
        <outline text="American Patriots rebelled against this oppressive “taxation without representation”"/>
        <outline text="The Continental Army, led by the Father of our Country (tm), George Washington, steadily attacked the British Army, which was the MOST POWERFUL in the world"/>
        <outline text="Something something George Washington and Valley Forge on Christmas Day, 1777"/>
        <outline text="The French started helping out a little bit providing some supplies and supplemental forces"/>
        <outline text="And… VOILA! Somehow the Americans DECISIVELY beat Cornwallis at Yorktown with the French forces in the audience"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="A MUCH Closer to ACTUAL narrative is:">
        <outline text="As a part of the Seven Years’ War, the British participated in the American theater against the French and decisively WON in that theater"/>
        <outline text="The Seven Years’ War caused a major re-alignment of imperial territory and alliances"/>
        <outline text="The British Crown protected its colonists and prosecuted a World War against its enemies, including France and won A LOT of territory as a result. They also protected their American colonies."/>
        <outline text="However, they were drained of resources because WOW A SEVEN YEAR WAR"/>
        <outline text="When the Crown sought to tax the colonists, the talk of rebellion started because the oligarch colonists thought they were owed free protection"/>
        <outline text="When the rebellion happened, the Continental Army and the Continental Congress could NOT ACTUALLY afford to fight a regularly-funded conventional war because ONLY the British pound was accepted as currency by both the rebels and and neutrals">
          <outline text="They couldn’t afford to fight LITERALLY because Colonial currency was NO GOOD"/>
          <outline text="The vast majority (if not all) of the colonists, whether rebels, rebel sympathizers, neutrals, or British sympathizers were financially betting on the British winning this conflict simply from the fact that they were using the British pound as the currency"/>
          <outline text="The oligarchs couldn’t actually afford to pay for the rebellion they instigated"/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Some years, the Continental army soldiers only got paid ONCE"/>
        <outline text="And they were facing off against the world’s most powerful imperial military"/>
        <outline text="It was “rebel diplomacy” that convinced the other world powers (France, Spain, and Holland) to join the American Rebellion as a “round 2” of the Seven Years’ War"/>
        <outline text="If it wasn’t for the French Army and Navy, the Americans would have lost and been re-subjugated"/>
        <outline text="Thought exercise: IF the Americans had ACTUALLY MILITARILY won that war, why were terms of victory and satisfaction negotiated in Paris? Why is American victory document called “The Treaty of Paris” if the Americans won? (Wouldn’t it have been named “The Treaty of New York” if that had ACTUALLY been the case?)"/>
      </outline>
    </outline>
    <outline text="Consequences of the Conventional Narrative">
      <outline text="Because everyone BELIEVES that there was some sort of “Divine Right of American Rebellion”, the Constitution is endowed with some wacky notions of immutability and inevitability"/>
      <outline text="Because the six firewalls prevent the Constitution from being structurally fixed, the American oligarchs (which are the ones whose literal and spiritual forefathers were the ones who fomented the original rebellion) get to stay in power in an unquestioned and unfixable way with all their elected and judicial puppets"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="Political Narrative Axioms">
      <outline text="Axiom 1: The American People do not tolerate the “perception of weakness”">
        <outline text="Corollary — Weirdly: casting yourself as a victim somehow makes you stronger by creating an “us versus them” narrative"/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Axiom 2: If the voters can’t understand you, they can’t vote for you"/>
      <outline text="Axiom 3: The American people have an emotional memory, not a factual memory."/>
      <outline text="Axiom 4: If you don’t define yourself and your opponent first, you better believe your opponent is going to define you."/>
      <outline text="Axiom 5: Ultimately, every campaign is a reflection of the candidate."/>
      <outline text="Axiom 6: The most important precinct in any campaign is the six inches between the candidate’s ears."/>
      <outline text="Axiom 7: If you have enough money, time and willpower, you can buy the perception of truth, no matter what the facts are.">
        <outline text="Corollary: The perception may be as solid as a sand castle and far more brittle."/>
      </outline>
      <outline text="Axiom 8: Political power always follows economic power"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="The (literal) value of history">
      <outline text="History is basically the transfer of economic and political power on a large scale"/>
      <outline text="Any historical narrative that doesn’t attempt to outline a “follow the money” narrative is mostly worthless or at best less-than-rigorous"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="If you can’t master the rules, you can’t break or change the rules">
      <outline text="If your history is hagiographic in nature towards its actors, consider you’re not very good at your job"/>
      <outline text="If your history or biography is hagiographic in nature, and you win awards for your work product, consider that both YOU and the PRIZE COMMITTEE are committed to the status quo"/>
