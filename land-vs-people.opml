      <outline text="Sure, you can pass a new law, but so what?">
        <outline text="It will get challenged"/>
        <outline text="The judge will be inclined to strike down the law as unconstitutional because it challenges the rule of the oligarchy"/>

      <outline text="If someone gets appointed in the 40s, they can expect to have a “judicial reign” of their court for 30 years"/>
      <outline text="Also, since impeachment and removal is so much harder (because of the supermajority requirements), corrupt federal judges cannot be held accountable"/>
      <outline text="SCOTUS justices are the worst, because they are literally “The Final Boss” court over every other court"/>
      <outline text="Also, there are no consequences for corrupt justices: they can literally DIE in their jobs and nothing will happen to them beyond them leaving a legacy of corruption (which, if they don’t care how people think about them, won’t actually change anything)"/>

    <outline text="Electoral College">
      <outline text="1. Loser of popular vote can still win the Presidency"/>

      <outline text="4. It distorts governance"/>
      <outline text="5. It distorts the one-person, one-vote principle of democracy"/>
      <outline text="6. It creates the possibility of a 269-269 tie"/>
      <outline text="7. Makes it functionally impossible for third parties to win the Presidency"/>

      <outline text="9. If there’s an EC tie, the choice should be thrown to the House of Representatives"/>
      <outline text="10. It was intended for there to be regular problems with the EC vote AND that the House should settle the matter"/>
      <outline text="11. Tilted towards the smaller states (any structure based on divisional units units instead of plurality of total votes will always favor smaller units)"/>
      <outline text="12. Intentionally designed to negate or dilute popular vote"/>
      <outline text="13. Created as “remedy” for the scenario for “what happens after G. Washington?”"/>
      <outline text="14. Left it up to each state legislature to decide how to choose electors"/>
      <outline text="15. If you have corruption at the state level, you’ll get a state corruptly assigning its EC votes to the corrupters’ preferred candidate in the case of an ambiguous outcome (see Florida 2000)"/>
      <outline text="16. Instead of one NATIONAL campaign, a candidate has to run 50+ campaigns"/>
      <outline text="17. The EC is designed to suppress overall voter participation"/>
      <outline text="18. It directly reflects the Founders’ contempt for democracy"/>
      <outline text="19. Because of how it works in practice, it winds up pitting different regions and different states of the country against each other"/>
      <outline text="20. No other democracy has ever copied it (which should tell you all you need to know about its quality as a small-d democratic mechanism)"/>

      <outline text="Mexicans are considered the Cheap Physical Labor"/>
      <outline text="Asian Americans are considered the Cheap-ish Intellectual Labor"/>
      <outline text="Prison labor has been with us since 1619">
        <outline text="And prisoners lose the right to vote once they are convicted"/>
        <outline text="Depending on the state, that right to vote will never be restored again (Florida and Texas)"/>

      <outline text="When they have enough money to buy lobbyists and legislatures?"/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="BONUS: Zero term limits">
      <outline text="Other than POTUS, no other federal official has term limits"/>
      <outline text="We can see the corruption of elected officials who get to stay in the same job forever (Mitch McConnell and Clarence Thomas, anyone?)"/>
      <outline text="This happens AT EVERY LEVEL: Corruption is the natural outcome of perpetual office-holding because …"/>
      <outline text="IF the leadership has no fear of facing criminal or civil consequences for their corruption as long as they stay in office or have continual connections to the local “power network”"/>
      <outline text="THEN they are going to keep getting more and more corrupt"/>
      <outline text="Also, the zero term limits problem can also source the corruption because it incentivizes office holders to rig the game to stay in office, especially if they’ve broken SOME laws, and are staying in office to avoid criminal prosecution and civil penalties"/>
